DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS FOR HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF SOCIETY KORNELIA BATKO  JOURNAL OF BIG DATA VOLUME  ARTICLE NUMBER   CITE THIS ARTICLE   ABSTRACT BACKGROUND ANY NATIONS HEALTH POLICY AIMS TO PROPERLY CARE FOR ITS CITIZENS AND THE SOCIETYS QUALITY OF LIFE SINCE IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE POPULATIONS HEALTH IS THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF NATIONAL WEALTH HEALTH IS TREATED AS A PUBLIC GOOD AND A SOCIAL VALUE THEREFORE IN RECENT TIMES IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL INSTRUMENTS FOR PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES HEALTH POLICY HAS INCREASINGLY TURNED TO INFORMATION INSTRUMENTS AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES  AIMS THE PAPER AIMS TO RECOGNIZE THE ROLE OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS BDA IN DEVELOPING DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION DSI IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD THE PROPOSAL OF THE AUTHORS INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLAN PLATFORM IHPP SOLUTION IS PRESENTED AS AN EXAMPLE OF DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION  MATERIAL AND METHODS THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE FOLLOWED BY A FOCUS GROUP STUDY AIMED AT DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS INCLUDING ESPECIALLY ANALYSIS BASED ON DATA FROM WEARABLES TO HELP MANAGE ONES HEALTH AND IMPROVE THE SOCIETYS WELLBEING THE FOCUS RESEARCH ALSO INCLUDED VERIFICATION OF THE RESEARCH MODEL PRESENTED IN THE ARTICLE AND EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLAN PLATFORM INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION AS A SOLUTION TO COMPLEMENT HEALTHCARE PROVIDED BY MEDICAL FACILITIES IN POLAND  RESULTS THE RESULTS OF THE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS SHOW THAT ANALYSING DATA FROM WEARABLES AND THE PROPOSED IHPP COULD BE HELPFUL IN MANAGING ONES OWN HEALTH AND HELPING TO LEVEL IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN HEALTHCARE  CONCLUSION ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS PAPER WAS TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF BDAS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL INNOVATIONS IN HEALTHCARE FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE RESULTS OF THE FOCUS GROUP STUDY AND DISCUSSION IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT BIG DATA ANALYTICS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP SOCIAL INNOVATION IN HEALTHCARE  INTRODUCTION INNOVATION HAS BECOME A KEY RESOURCE TO ALL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY AND THE HEALTH SECTOR IS NOT AN EXCEPTION THE IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATIONS IN THE HEALTH SECTOR IS UNDENIABLE OVER THE YEARS HEALTHCARE INNOVATIONS HAVE BEEN AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF IMPROVING PEOPLES HEALTH AND WELLBEING THIS INCLUDES INNOVATIONS IN THE FIELD OF NEW MEDICAL SOLUTIONS NEW DRUGS TREATMENT METHODS NEW CLINICAL PROCEDURES AND THE ROBOTIZATION OF HEALTHCARE   MOREOVER SOCIAL INNOVATION IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN MODERN SOCIETY AND ECONOMIES SOCIAL INNOVATION IS SEEN AS A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOCIAL NEEDS THAN EXISTING SOLUTIONS RESULTING FOR EXAMPLE FROM WORKING CONDITIONS EDUCATION COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OR HEALTH   HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT INNOVATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED ON ALREADY EXISTING STRUCTURES WHICH BECOME THE BASIS AND A PREREQUISITE FOR ANY INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT THEREFORE THE BASICEXISTING STRUCTURES ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF FIRST AND IF THEY WORK POORLY OR DO NOT WORK AT ALL EVEN INNOVATIVE APPROACHES CANNOT REPLACE THEM AND ENABLE CITIZENS TO MEET THEIR SOCIAL NEEDS SOCIAL INNOVATION CAN COMPETE WITH AN EXISTING STANDARD SOLUTION POTENTIAL USERS WILL HAVE TO ANALYSE WHETHER THE INNOVATIVE ALTERNATIVE OFFERS ADDED VALUE COMPARED TO THE EXISTING KNOWN SOLUTION  THEY WILL USE IT IF IT SATISFIES THEIR NEEDS TO A HIGHER EXTENT THAN THE OLD SOLUTION AND IF THIS BENEFIT IS WORTH THE FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL COST  OTHER INNOVATIONS OFFER A COMPLETELY NEW SOLUTION SERVICE PRODUCT OR MEET A NEED THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY COMPLETELY UNCOVERED THERE IS A NOTICEABLE DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH ON SOCIAL INNOVATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS SERVICES MODELS AIMED AT IMPROVING AND SUPPORTING ALL SOCIAL CHANGES  SOCIAL INNOVATIONS DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL INNOVATIONS MAINLY IN TERMS OF GENERATING VALUE FOR THE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ENVIRONMENT OF ORGANIZATIONS IE CUSTOMERS SUPPLIERS AND VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS  THE VALUES DEVELOPED AS PART OF SOCIAL INNOVATIONS CAN IMPROVE SOCIAL RELATIONS COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION THE INHERENT GOAL OF SOCIAL INNOVATION IS TO IMPROVE PEOPLES QUALITY OF LIFE CREATE AND SHARE THESE VALUES NOT ONLY IN THE ECONOMIC SENSE BUT ABOVE ALL IN THE SOCIAL SENSE  AN ESSENTIAL PART OF SOCIAL INNOVATION IS DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION DSI IN THE LITERATURE THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE THAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CAN PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN VARIOUS SOCIAL PROCESSES EG COMMUNICATION OR COOPERATION           HOWEVER THERE STILL NEEDS TO BE MORE RESEARCH AIMED AT EXPLORING THE ISSUES OF COMPUTERAIDED SOCIAL INNOVATION THE RESEARCH GAP ALSO INCLUDES ILLUSTRATING THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE USED IN SUPPORTING SOCIAL INNOVATION  IN GENERAL DSI IS A YOUNG FIELD OF RESEARCH WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN MORE DEPTH INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF ITS SPECIFIC USE MOREOVER THERE IS NO RESEARCH ILLUSTRATING WHETHER BIG DATA ANALYSES CAN SUPPORT DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION WHICH DETERMINES THEIR APPLICATION AND THE WAYS OF DESIGNING DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION SOLUTIONS SYSTEMS APPS WEBSITES BASED ON DATA STREAM ANALYSIS FOR THIS REASON THE PAPER AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE POSSIBILITIES OF USING BIG DATA ANALYTICS TO CREATE DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION IN SOCIETYS HEALTH AND WELLBEING THE STUDY FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS  SPECIFICATION AND APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS IN HEALTHCARE  THE BENEFITS AND BARRIERS OF HEALTHCARE BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS AND WEARABLES  THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS ON ELIMINATING THE PROBLEMS HEALTHCARE IS CURRENTLY FACING THE RESEARCH PRESENTED IN THE ARTICLE WILL USE SUCH METHODOLOGIES AS WORLD LITERATURE QUERY AND CASE STUDIES IN THE FIELD OF SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION RELATED TO HEALTHCARE AND HEALTHCARE BIG DATA ANALYTICS THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY ALSO CONSISTS OF DATA COLLECTION METHODS TRANSCRIPTION ANALYSIS PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS THE RESEARCH WAS EXPLORATORY AND QUALITATIVE IN ITS NATURE AS THE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE ARTICLE ARE LESS WIDELY STUDIED AT THE SAME TIME IT IS COMPLEX AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO INITIAL VERIFICATION USING THE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEW METHOD  RELATED WORKS CONTEMPORARY APPROACHES TO HEALTH AND WELLBEING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTH POLICY AND ITS GOALS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PROPERLY TAKE CARE OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF CITIZENS AND SOCIETY BECAUSE IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE POPULATIONS HEALTH IS THE MOST CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF NATIONAL WEALTH THUS HEALTH IS A PUBLIC GOOD AND A SOCIAL VALUE    THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION EQUATES HEALTH WITH A STATE OF COMPLETE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELLBEING AND NOT MERELY THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE OR INFIRMITY WHOFOOTNOTE GOOD HEALTH IS A CONDITION FOR THE PARTICIPATION OF INDIVIDUALS IN VARIOUS AREAS OF SOCIAL LIFE HEALTH AND ILLNESS ARE NOT ONLY A PROBLEM OF THE HUMAN INDIVIDUAL BUT ALSO A CHERISHED VALUE OF THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT  THUS THE TASK OF HEALTH POLICY SHOULD BE TO IMPROVE HEALTH MEET HEALTH NEEDS OR PROVIDE HEALTH SERVICES    TEREFORE THE GOALS OF HEALTH POLICY INCLUDE PROLONGING LIFE AND ELIMINATING PREMATURE DEATHS MINIMIZING DEVIATIONS FROM PHYSIOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL NORMS THROUGH PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND EARLY DETECTION OF DISEASES STRENGTHENING RESISTANCE TO DISEASE MINIMIZING DISCOMFORT AND DISABILITY STRENGTHENING HEALTH POTENTIAL AND FOSTERING A SENSE OF WELLBEING AND SELFREALIZATION     TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES INVOLVING THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FROM THE STATE TO THE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE HEALTH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH POLICY MEASURES IS CONSIDERED FROM THE LEVEL OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT ARISE IN A PARTICULAR AREA  ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PROBLEMS FACING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS THE AGING OF THE POPULATION WHICH AFFECTS BOTH THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION  THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF PREPARING FOR OLD AGE ACTIVITIES IN POLAND AS TOO LITTLE ATTENTION IS PAID TO MAINTAINING PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITY NOT ONLY IN OLD AGE BUT ALSO MUCH EARLIER THIS SHOULD BE THE AXIS OF PREVENTIVE AND HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES WE CAN FEEL THE SHORTTERM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IN THE FORM OF POORER HEALTH PARAMETERS FOR YOUNG ADULTS AND THE FURTHER RESULT FOR OLDER ADULTS AND OLDER PEOPLE ALSO DISEASES UNDIAGNOSED AND UNTREATED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF LIFE CAN GENERATE HIGH MEDICAL COSTS IN THE FUTURE  THEREFORE HEALTH POLICY IN RECENT TIMES HAS INCREASINGLY TURNED TO INFORMATION INSTRUMENTS AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL TOOLS TO SUPPORT HEALTHY LIFESTYLES DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR IDENTIFYING NEEDS AND DELIVERING HEALTH CARE FROM PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION TO TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS AND SELFMANAGEMENT  DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF HEALTH SERVICES CAN ENSURE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF HEALTH SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO DIGITALLY SUPPORTED HEALTH SERVICES AS PART OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION WE CAN MANAGE OUR HEALTH THROUGH SELFCARE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEFINES SELFCARE AS THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE THEIR HEALTH PREVENT DISEASE MAINTAIN HEALTH AND TO COPE WITH ILLNESS AND DISABILITY WITH OR WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A HEALTH WORKERFOOTNOTE SELFCARE IS EVERYTHING ONE DOES TO TAKE CARE OF ONESELF TO MAINTAIN THEIR PHYSICAL MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING  RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT SELFCARE PROMOTES POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CAN HELP PREVENT FUTURE HEALTH PROBLEMS BUT IT IS NOT A CURE OR TREATMENT FOR DISEASES  MOREOVER IN RECENT YEARS HEALTHCARE STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE GLOBE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR NEW INNOVATIVE COSTEFFECTIVE WAYS TO DELIVER PATIENTCENTRED TECHNOLOGYENABLED SMART HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SEEKING TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OFFERED AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND PLACE FOR THE SPECIFIC PATIENT CLINICIANS USE TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND ANALYTICS TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT ILLNESSES AND DELIVER CARE MORE ACCURATELY HEALTHCARE IS PATIENTCENTRED AND IT IS BASED ON PATIENTS ENGAGEMENT PATIENTS ARE INFORMED AND ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THEIR TREATMENT PLANS THE ADOPTION OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRES DECISION SUPPORT IN FIVE AREAS    THE RIGHT WAY OF LIFETHE PATIENTS COMMITMENT TO A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE  PROPER MEDICAL CAREAPPLICATION OF APPROPRIATE MEDICAL PROCEDURES TO PATIENTS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND PROVISION OF ACCESS TO ALL THEIR DATA TO OPTIMIZE THE TREATMENT PROCESS  THE RIGHT CARE PROVIDERTHE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAL PROCEDURES BY HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF ENGAGING SPECIALIST DOCTORS ONLY IN SITUATIONS REQUIRING THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND OTHER MEDICAL PERSONNEL IN THE REMAINING CASES  THE PROPER VALUE OF MEDICAL CAREIMPROVING THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL SERVICES AND ELIMINATING ECONOMICALLY UNJUSTIFIED EXPENSES FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND INSTITUTIONS  PROPER INNOVATIONSIDENTIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TREATMENT METHODS AND ORGANIZATIONAL SOLUTIONS BY NEW HEALTH SYSTEM ENTITIES  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CONCEPT REQUIRES A NEW APPROACH TO HUMAN HEALTH AS WELL AS TO THE WHOLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS MENTIONED BEFORE A CONCEPT THAT IS GAINING IN IMPORTANCE IN THIS AREA IS HEALTH CULTURE CONNECTED WITH A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH TO HEALTH PROMOTION AND MAINTENANCE  IN THE CULTURE OF HEALTH THE LATTER TOGETHER WITH WELLBEING ARE PRIORITIES WHILE PROHEALTH BEHAVIOUR PREVENTION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ARE PROMOTED CITIZENS CAN MAKE CHOICES AND CONTRIBUTE TO A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES THE USE OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS MAY BE HELPFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY USED TO SUPPORT PREVENTION AND A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE ALSO PLAYS A VITAL ROLE THE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS AIMED AT CREATING INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE AS A NEW DRIVER TO IMPROVE THE SOCIETYS QUALITY OF LIFE THIS INVOLVES INDIVIDUALS MANAGING THEIR HEALTH AND WELLBEING THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE FOR THIS PURPOSE BIOLOGICAL PHYSICAL BEHAVIOURAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS SHOULD BE MONITORED ASSISTED BY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THIS INCLUDES EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTION OF ILLNESS OR HEALTH THEREFORE INNOVATIONS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED IN HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BUT SHOULD ALSO COVER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE BORN AND IN WHICH THEY LIVE WORK AND EXIST     THE OVERRIDING TASK OF INTRODUCING A HEALTH CULTURE IS TO IMPROVE THE POPULATIONS HEALTH WHICH REQUIRES A BROADER APPROACH THAT CONSIDERS IN ADDITION TO HEALTH FACTORS ALSO SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS    THIS IS IN LINE WITH INTRODUCING SOCIAL INNOVATION IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH  HUMAN HEALTH AND A SENSE OF WELLBEING CAN BE SEEN AS A LIFELONG PROCESS NOT JUST AS A BIOLOGICAL GOOD IN EVERYDAY LIFE PEOPLE BEGIN TO PERCEIVE LIFE AS A VALUE ANALYSE THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND CONSTANTLY EVALUATE IT THE DEGREE OF THE SENSE OF ONES INFLUENCE ON THE SURROUNDING REALITY HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THIS MODEL AS AN ESSENTIAL VARIABLE DETERMINING HEALTHRELATED BEHAVIOURS THEREFORE HEALTH AND WELLBEING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A UNIQUE RESOURCE THAT CAN BE ADEQUATELY MANAGED THIS MANAGEMENT ESSENTIALLY INVOLVES IDENTIFYING DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND WELLBEING THAT CAN BE MODIFIED OVER TIME AND CHANGING ONES LIFESTYLE OR LIVING CONDITIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IMPACT HEALTH AND WELLBEING  AMONG THESE DETERMINANTS SOME CAN AND OTHERS CANNOT BE INFLUENCED DETERMINANTS THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFLUENCED INCLUDE   HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND LIFESTYLE  EMPLOYMENT AND WORK PERFORMED  INCOME AND SOCIAL STATUS  EDUCATION  SOCIAL STATUS  FAMILY STATUS  PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT  ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTH SERVICES  DETERMINANTS BEYOND CONTROL INCLUDE THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF EACH PERSON GENETIC CONDITIONS OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS  PROPER MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH AND WELLBEING CAN INFLUENCE THE SHAPING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PATHS IN TURN THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO CONTROL TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS AND INTRODUCES PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES THAT HELP TO AVOID THE INCIDENCE OF VARIOUS DISEASES INCLUDING DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND MINIMIZE THE RISK OF PREMATURE DEATH   THE NEED TO CREATE A HEALTH CULTURE AS A STANDARD SOCIAL GOOD IS RECOGNIZED HOWEVER HEALTH AND WELLBEING ARE NONOBJECTIVE VALUES AS THEY RELATE NOT ONLY TO THE WELLBEING OF A PERSON AND THEIR HEALTH CONSTITUTING AN OBJECTIVE VALUE BUT ALSO TO A SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION OF HEALTH THE ISSUE OF WELLBEING IS ALSO RELATED TO QUALITY OF LIFE QOL WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE WELLBEING OF INDIVIDUALS DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO CAPTURE BOTH INDIVIDUAL EXPECTATIONS AND OBJECTIVE HEALTH  BIG DATA ANALYTICS IS A USEFUL TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH AND WELLBEING BIG DATA INFORMATION RESULTING FROM NORMALIZED DATA FLOW MAY REPRESENT AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO FUTURE EVALUATION OF WELLBEING BOTH AT THE POPULATION LEVEL AND AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL IT CAN FORM THE BASIS UNDERLYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES BUT ALSO FOR MANAGING ONES HEALTH  DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION IN HEALTHCARE THE WORLD TODAY IS STRUGGLING WITH MANY SOCIAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING AN AGING POPULATION FALLING BIRTH RATES DISEASES LINKED TO THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND THE IMPACT OF THE COVID PANDEMIC ON THE HEALTH OF SOCIETY PROGRESSIVE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES AND MODERNDAY DISEASES ARE A CHALLENGE FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE AGING SOCIETIES ARE ALSO VISIBLE AS LIFE EXPECTANCY INCREASES AND FERTILITY RATES DECLINE A WORRYING TREND IS ALSO THE INCREASING INCIDENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASES CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES CANCER DIABETES CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS SKELETAL MUSCLE DISORDERS CAUSED BY UNHEALTHY URBAN LIFESTYLES AND INADEQUATE SERVICE PROVISION THEREFORE IMPROVING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND INTRODUCING INNOVATIONS TO MEDICAL FACILITIES OR DOCTORS OFFICES IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND PROSPER IT IS NECESSARY TO TREAT THE PATIENT AS A GENUINE PARTNER  MANY AUTHORS POINT TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF USING SOCIAL INNOVATIONS IN VARIOUS AREAS OF SOCIOECONOMIC LIFE SOCIAL INNOVATION FOCUSES ON ISSUES SUCH AS DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING BETTER WAYS TO MEET SOCIAL NEEDS NEW IDEAS THAT WORK TO MEET IMPORTANT UNMET NEEDS AND NEW IDEAS THAT SOLVE EXISTING SOCIAL CULTURAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE AND PLANETS OR IDEAS WORKING FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD WRONKAPOŚPIECH  THEREFORE ALTHOUGH MOST DEFINITIONS OF SOCIAL INNOVATION PRESENT IT AS NEW IDEAS OR SOLUTIONS THEY REMAIN AGNOSTIC OF THE FORM IT CAN TAKE AS NEW PRODUCTS PROGRAMMES SERVICES PROCESSES ACTIVITIES PRACTICES OR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS  SUCH SOCIAL INNOVATIONS AIM TO IMPROVE THE LIFE OF SOCIETY IN THE AREAS OF ITS FUNCTIONING AND TO OBTAIN LASTING SOCIAL VALUE SOCIAL INNOVATION GIVES US A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON STRENGTHENING HEALTHCARE AND BECOMES AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF INNOVATIVE HEALTH POLICY THAT SOLVES SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND CREATES VALUE IN AREAS SERVING SOCIETY IN THE HEALTH FIELD IT IS INDICATED THAT SOCIAL INNOVATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PRODUCING NEW KNOWLEDGE AND ADAPTING EXISTING KNOWLEDGE BETTER TO MEET SOCIAL NEEDS IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND WELLBEING  THE BASIS OF THIS APPROACH IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE CAN BE COMPETENT INTERPRETERS OF THEIR OWN LIVES AND THEY SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED SOCIAL INNOVATION IS SIMPLY PROBLEM SOLVING AND MORE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDING A CREATIVE AND UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO SOLVING COMPLEX PROBLEMS THAT COULD NOT BE SOLVED OTHERWISE  SOCIAL INNOVATION PROJECTS IN HEALTHCARE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS AND ARE MOST OFTEN A COMBINATION OF THESE FORMS THESE CAN BE   PROCESSES EG REORGANIZED CARE PATHWAYS  PRODUCTS EG APPLICATIONS FOR MOBILE PHONES  MARKET MECHANISMS EG SOCIAL FINANCING INSTRUMENTS  BEHAVIOURAL ROLES AND PRACTICES EG PEERTOPEER SERVICES  NEW PARADIGMS AND POLICIES  IN THE LITERATURE ONE CAN FIND EXAMPLES OF SOCIAL INNOVATION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF HEALTHCARE TARGETING DISEASES AND DIFFERENT PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTED INNOVATIONS INCLUDE   ADDRESSING THE FAILURES OF THE WELFARE STATE RELATED TO THE INABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO SUSTAIN THE INCREASING HEALTH EXPENDITURE OF AGING POPULATIONS  INCREASING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH CARE OFTEN AS A STRATEGY TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF CARE FROM THE STATE TO INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER ACTORS THROUGH SOCIAL ENTERPRISES  SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH FAILURES IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM  OVERCOMING THE VERTICAL SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL LOW SATISFACTION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND BURDENSOME BUREAUCRATIC CARE PROCESSES  PROMOTING STANDARDIZED DISEASE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES BASED ON PATIENTCENTRED PRINCIPLES  IN THE AREA OF HEALTHCARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIAL INNOVATION CAN BE IDENTIFIED ACCORDING TO MASON ET AL FOUR TYPES OF SOCIAL INNOVATION IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE CAN BE DISTINGUISHED SOCIAL MOVEMENTS INCLUDING NETWORKS OF INFORMAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MANY PEOPLE GROUPS ANDOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACHIEVE A GOAL OR SOLVE A PROBLEM SERVICES SOCIAL INNOVATION AIMED AT IMPROVING SERVICES THROUGH COLLABORATIVE AND CROSSSECTORAL DESIGN AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES SOCIAL ENTERPRISES INNOVATIVE FORMS OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIPENTERPRISES THAT EXIST TO ACHIEVE A SOCIAL GOAL AND TYPICALLY REINVEST A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR PROFITS OR SURPLUSES TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION BASED ON COLLABORATION BETWEEN INNOVATORS USERS AND A SOCIETY THAT USES DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO COCREATE KNOWLEDGE AND SOLUTIONS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIAL NEEDS   THIS RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION DSI MUMFORD ET AL  STATED THAT SOCIAL INNOVATION IS THE GENERATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW IDEAS ABOUT PEOPLE AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITHIN A SOCIAL SYSTEM WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES SOCIAL INNOVATIONS MAY AT TIMES FORCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES BUT AT OTHER TIMES TECHNOLOGY MAY FORCE THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSED SOCIAL INNOVATIONS  THUS DSI REFERS TO THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW SOLUTIONS THAT IMPLY A CONCEPTUAL PROCESSRELATED PRODUCTRELATED OR ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE TO IMPROVE THE WELLBEING OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES  DIGITAL INNOVATION IS THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS TO IMPROVE EXISTING BUSINESS PROCESSES AND WORKFORCE EFFICIENCY IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS MODELS OR IMPROVE SUCH PRODUCTS SUCH AS MOBILE APPLICATIONS INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR WEBSITES THAT FACILITATE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HEALTHCARE STAKEHOLDERS DSI CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS ONLINE PLATFORMS OR APPLICATIONS THAT ENABLE CITIZENS TO CONNECT AND COLLABORATE     NOWADAYS A CONNECTED WORLD ALLOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES THAT SOURCE CROWD TALENT CREATING VALUE FOR INDIVIDUALS GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS  THE VALUE OF DSI FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY IS THE ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO NEW HEALTH SOLUTIONS DRAWING ON EMPIRICAL AND PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY COMPLEMENT THAT OF EXPERTS OR THE PROCESS ITSELF LEADING TO NEW FORMS OF POWER RELATIONS AND EMPOWERMENT  THE OVERRIDING GOAL OF IMPLEMENTING DIGITAL INNOVATIONS IS TO REORIENT TECHNOLOGY TOWARDS SOCIAL GOALS AND USE IT TO IMPROVE LIFE AND CREATE VALUE FOR SOCIETY THE BENEFITS THAT SOCIETY CAN OBTAIN INCLUDE ENABLING CITIZENS TO TAKE GREATER CONTROL OF THEIR OWN LIVES AND TO MAKE POSITIVE USE OF THEIR COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ALONG WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF SOCIAL INNOVATION SPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO PREPARING POTENTIAL USERS FOR ITS EXPLOITATION CITIZENS SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY INFORMED EDUCATED TRAINED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIAL INNOVATION IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE CARE OF ADEQUATE PUBLICITY OF THE PROJECT EDUCATION OF POTENTIAL USERS OR SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF COMPETENCIES NECESSARY TO USE THIS INNOVATION TO OBTAIN THE ASSUMED ADDITIONAL VALUES INTRODUCING SOCIAL INNOVATION IN SOME CASES WILL REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOLISTIC PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL CHANGES  IN THE CASE OF DSI DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS SEEN AS A TOOL NOT AS AN OUTCOME DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IS A WAY TO SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THE TERM DSI LARGELY OVERLAPS WITH OTHER TERMS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY FOR GOOD CITIZEN TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL TECHNOLOGY  CREATING DSI IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD ENABLES THE COCREATION AND EXCHANGE OF KNOWLEDGE AND SOLUTIONS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIAL NEEDS INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ICT SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT SOCIAL INNOVATION MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP THE CONCEPTS OF OPEN DATA OPEN EQUIPMENT OPEN NETWORKS AND OPEN KNOWLEDGE AND ARE AIMED AT CREATING ONLINE COMMUNITIES  USING DATA AND INTERNET SOLUTIONS INCREASES THE VARIETY OF POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR VALUE CREATION DATA ESPECIALLY BIG DATA IS BECOMING THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DSI IN HEALTHCARE  HEALTHCARE BIG DATA IN THE LITERATURE THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT ICT CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN VARIOUS SOCIAL PROCESSES             IT IS THEREFORE CLEAR THAT THE DEMAND FOR DSI IS CONSTANTLY GROWING DSI MAY DEVELOP IN THE AREA OF HEALTHCARE WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY BIG DATA ANALYSTS WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY BIG DATA TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN WIDELY APPLIED ALSO IN HEALTHCARE   HEALTHCARE HAS ALWAYS GENERATED HUGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND NOWADAYS THE INTRODUCTION OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS EMR AS WELL AS THE HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA SENT BY VARIOUS TYPES OF SENSORS OR GENERATED BY PATIENTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA CAUSE DATA STREAMS TO CONSTANTLY GROW ANALYSIS OF BIG DATA HAS PENETRATED THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY AND WITH THE PROCESS OF MEDICAL INFORMATION DIGITALIZATION MANY ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS MEDICAL IMAGING GENOMIC DATA HEALTH BEHAVIOUR DATA AND OTHER DATA HAS EMERGED PROPER USE OF SUCH DATA WILL ALLOW HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT CLINICAL DECISIONMAKING DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT THE CHALLENGE POSED BY CLINICAL DATA PROCESSING INVOLVES THE QUANTITY OF DATA AND ITS COMPLEXITY  THE CONCEPT OF BIG DATA HAS EVOLVED IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER IT IS STILL NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BIG DATA CAN BE TREATED AS A LARGE AMOUNT OF DIGITAL DATA LARGE DATA SETS TECHNOLOGY A TOOL OR A PHENOMENON CULTURAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL THEREFORE INSTEAD OF DEFINING THIS PHENOMENON MORE AUTHORS ARE DESCRIBING BIG DATA BY GIVING IT CHARACTERISTICS COMBINED INTO A COLLECTION OF VS RELATED TO ITS NATURE        VOLUME REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF DATA AND IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN BIG DATA ANALYTICS  VELOCITY THE SPEED WITH WHICH NEW DATA IS GENERATED THE CHALLENGE IS TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE DATA EFFECTIVELY AND IN REAL TIME  VARIETY HETEROGENEITY OF DATA MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTHCARE DATA THE CHALLENGE IS TO DERIVE INSIGHTS BY LOOKING AT ALL AVAILABLE HETEROGENEOUS DATA HOLISTICALLY  VARIABILITY INCONSISTENCY OF DATA THE CHALLENGE IS TO CORRECT THE INTERPRETATION OF DATA THAT CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT  VERACITY HOW TRUSTWORTHY THE DATA IS QUALITY OF THE DATA  VISUALIZATION ABILITY TO INTERPRET DATA AND RESULTING INSIGHTS CHALLENGING FOR BIG DATA DUE TO ITS OTHER FEATURES DESCRIBED ABOVE  VALUE BIG DATA ANALYTICS AIMS TO DISCOVER THE HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE FROM VAST BIG DATACAN BE DEFINED AS A COLLECTION OF DATA ELEMENTS WHOSE SIZE SPEED TYPE ANDOR COMPLEXITY REQUIRE ONE TO SEEK ADOPT AND INVENT NEW HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE MECHANISMS TO SUCCESSFULLY STORE ANALYSE AND VISUALIZE THE DATA     BIG DATA IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA GENERATED SWIFTLY AND CONTAINING MUCH CONTENT COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES WITH DIFFERENT DATA PROPERTIES AND PROCESSED BY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS RESULTING IN A BIG DATA CHAIN  THIS DATA COMES FROM UNSTRUCTURED SOURCES SUCH AS STREAMS OF CLICKS ON THE WEB SOCIAL NETWORKS VIDEO RECORDINGS RECORDINGS OF CALLS REALTIME INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SENSORS RFID GPS DEVICES MOBILE PHONES AND OTHER DEVICES WHICH IDENTIFY AND MONITOR VARIOUS ASPECTS  BIG DATA CAN ALSO BE DEFINED AS AN INFORMATION ASSET WITH HIGH DIVERSITY VOLUME VELOCITY AND VARIETY WHICH REQUIRES SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY AND METHOD FOR ITS TRANSFORMATION INTO VALUE  UNDOUBTEDLY BIG DATA DIFFERS FROM THE DATA SOURCES USED SO FAR BY ORGANIZATIONS THEREFORE ORGANIZATIONS MUST APPROACH THIS TYPE OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND START TO SEE DATA AS FLOWS AND NOT STOCKSTHIS ENTAILS THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE STREAMING ANALYTICS THESE FEATURES MAKE IT NECESSARY TO USE NEW IT TOOLS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO USE NEW DATA TO THE FULLEST EXTENT  THE ABOVE FEATURES MAKE IT NECESSARY TO USE NEW IT TOOLS THAT ALLOW THE FULL USE OF FURTHER DATA AND TREAT IT AS FLOWS NOT STOCKS BIG DATA REQUIRING NEW FORMS OF PROCESSING IN ORDER TO SUPPORT DECISIONMAKING DISCOVERING NEW PHENOMENA AND PROCESS OPTIMIZATION THE BIG DATA CONCEPT IS CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AND DOES NOT FOCUS ON VAST AMOUNTS OF DATA BUT ON CREATING VALUE THEREFROM   THE BIG DATA PROBLEM IN HEALTHCARE IS NOT LIMITED TO THE OVERWHELMING VOLUME BUT IS ALSO RELATED TO THE UNPRECEDENTED DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF TYPES DATA FORMATS AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH IT SHOULD BE ANALYSED TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS  IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR BIG DATA STREAMS CONSIST OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DATA NAMELY     CLINICAL DATA FOR INSTANCE DATA OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS DATA FROM HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS IMAGE CENTRES LABORATORIES PHARMACIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING HEALTH SERVICES PATIENTGENERATED HEALTH DATA PHYSICIANS FREETEXT NOTES GENOMIC DATA PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING DATA   BIOMETRIC DATA SUPPLIED FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF DEVICES THAT MONITOR WEIGHT PRESSURE GLUCOSE LEVEL ETC  FINANCIAL DATA CONSTITUTING A COMPLETE RECORD OF ECONOMIC OPERATIONS REFLECTING THE CONDUCTED ACTIVITY  DATA FROM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ACTIVITIES EG RESULTS OF RESEARCH INCLUDING DRUG RESEARCH DESIGN OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND NEW METHODS OF TREATMENT  DATA PROVIDED BY PATIENTS INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF PREFERENCES LEVEL OF SATISFACTION AND INFORMATION FROM SYSTEMS FOR SELFMONITORING THEIR ACTIVITY EXERCISES SLEEP MEALS CONSUMED ETC  DATA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA  AN INTERESTING CLASSIFICATION OF BIG DATA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ITS SOURCE IS PRESENTED BY  DIVIDING BIG DATA INTO MOLECULAR BIG DATA OBTAINED BY MEANS OF WETLAB TECHNIQUES AND OMICSBASED APPROACHES SUCH AS GENOMICS AND POSTGENOMICS SPECIALTIES INCLUDING PROTEOMICS AND INTERACTOMICS IMAGINGBASED BIG DATA SUCH AS RADIOMICS OR THE MASSIVE DATAMINING APPROACH TO EXTRACT CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL HIGHDIMENSIONAL INFORMATION FROM IMAGES SENSORBASED BIG DATA WEARABLE SENSORS AND DIGITAL AND COMPUTATIONAL BIG DATA WITH AN INCREDIBLE WEALTH OF DATA PRODUCED BY THE INTERNET SMARTPHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES  THIS PAPER WILL PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO DATA FROM MEDICAL SYSTEMS TRANSACTIONAL SYSTEMS AND DATA FROM WEARABLES IN TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS PATIENT DATA INCLUDING VITAL SIGNS IS ROUTINELY COLLECTED MANUALLY BY STANDALONE MEDICAL DEVICES THE INTRODUCTION OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS IOT AND BD TECHNOLOGIES HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR PATIENTS HEALTH AND VITAL SIGNS THROUGH SMART DEVICES SMART SENSORS AS WELL AS SMART WEARABLE DEVICES THUS WEARABLE DEVICES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM MEDICINE ENABLING AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC AND HEALTH MONITORING PROCESSES COMBINING BDA WITH WEARABLES TECHNOLOGY CAN DEFINITELY BRING NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO HEALTHCARE AS IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO EFFECTIVELY USE BIG DATA TO SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTHCARE FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DISEASE SURVEILLANCE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND PERSONALIZED HEALTH MANAGEMENT  WEARABLES DEVICES PROVIDE FIRSTHAND DATA AND REALTIME MONITORING  CAN HELP TRANSFORM TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS INTO PROACTIVE SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS TO MANAGE THEIR CARE AT AN EARLY STAGE OFFER PERSONALIZED SERVICES TO PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS AND CAN BE ALSO USED FOR PATIENTS AND DISEASES MANAGEMENT  WEARABLE DEVICES INCLUDE ANY DEVICE THAT CAN BE WORN BY HUMANS SUCH AS WRISTWATCHES GLASSES CHEST STRAPS RINGS EARRINGS SHOES AND CLOTHING AND CAN CAPTURE NONINVASIVE SIGNALS FROM THE HUMAN BODY THROUGH THE USE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSORS SABRY ET AL  DESCRIBED NUMEROUS WELLKNOWN SIGNALS FROM THE HUMAN BODY AND THE TECHNOLOGY SENSORS USED TO CAPTURE THEM THE FULL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOST POPULAR WEARABLES WITH A LIST OF CAPABILITIES FUNCTIONS ACCURACIES AND USES WERE DESCRIBED BY AROGANAM ET AL CHAKRABARTI ET AL  AND NAHAVANDI ET AL   THE MAIN PURPOSE OF WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES IS TO CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR A PERSONS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND BEHAVIOUR AS WELL AS PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS DURING DAILY LIFE  MOST COMMONLY MEASURED DATA INCLUDE VITAL SIGNS SUCH AS HEART RATE BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS BLOOD OXYGEN SATURATION POSTURE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY VIA ELECTROCARDIOGRAM ECG SLEEP QUALITY AND STRESS LEVELS WEARABLE DEVICES BELONG TO THE INTERNET OF MEDICAL THINGS IOMT TOGETHER WITH THE IMPLANTABLE AMBIENT AND STATIONARY DEVICES USED IN HOSPITALS  WEARABLE DEVICES CAN COLLECT VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL DATA DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY RECORD DATA AT HIGH FREQUENCY COMBINED WITH POTENTIAL USE BY A LARGE POPULATION THE DATA COLLECTED FITS INTO THE DOMAIN OF BIG DATA MEETING THE FOUR VS VOLUME VARIETY VERACITY VELOCITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LATTER  SINCE WEARABLES CAN COLLECT HIGHLY PERSONALIZED DATA AMONG LARGE POPULATIONS THE COLLECTED INFORMATION CAN NOT ONLY BE USED TO IMPROVE PERSONALIZED INTERVENTION BUT ALSO TO DISCOVER POPULATION PATTERNS  THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE HEALTH DATA SETS COLLECTED BY THESE DEVICES HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ACCURACY OF PREDICTIONS RELATED TO THE HEALTH STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS IT HAS ALSO ENABLED ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS THAT OFFER PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE TOOLS WHICH IN TURN HAS INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND REDUCING THE RISK OF SERIOUS DISEASES  WITH WEARABLES WE CAN CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR THE VITAL SIGNS HEART RATE SATURATION TEMPERATURE NUMBER OF STEPS LOCATION WEIGHT SLEEP QUALITY STRESS ECG ETC LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOUR AND WELLBEING OF EACH USER MEDICAL WEARABLE DEVICES WITH SENSORS COLLECT EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH THIS GIVES US ENTIRELY NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ON THE UPLOADED DATA IN THE FORM OF TREND TRACKING CAPTURE ANOMALIES AND PREDICT THE FUTURE HEALTH AND LIFE OF THE USER BEING ANALYSED SEVERAL TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR PREVENTING OR MANAGING CHRONIC DISEASES THESE INCLUDE DEVICES THAT CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR HEALTH INDICATORS AUTOMATICALLY DELIVER TREATMENT OR MONITOR HEALTH DATA IN REAL TIME AS THE PATIENT SELFADMINISTERS THERAPY WITH THE RISE OF HIGHSPEED INTERNET ACCESS AND SMARTPHONES MANY PATIENTS HAVE BEGUN USING MOBILE APPS TO MANAGE THEIR VARIOUS HEALTH NEEDS  THEREFORE THERE IS POTENTIAL IN HEALTHCARE BIG DATA ANALYSES ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE SAVING LIVES OR REDUCING COSTS  DISENTANGLING THIS COMPLEX NETWORK OF ASSOCIATION RULES PATTERNS AND TRENDS WILL ALLOW HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR TO OFFER MORE ACCURATE AND MORE INSIGHTFUL DIAGNOSES OF PATIENTS PERSONALIZED TREATMENT AS WELL AS BETTER QUALITY OF MEDICAL SERVICES AND PATIENT CARE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO REDUCE COSTS DUE TO THE GROWING DIVERSITY AND QUANTITY OF DATA SOURCES ADVANCED ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND BIG DATA ANALYSIS METHODS WHICH CAN MEET AND EXCEED THE POSSIBILITIES OF MANAGING HEALTHCARE DATA ARE NEEDED  BIG DATA HAS GREAT POTENTIAL IN HEALTHCARE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EPIDEMIOLOGISTS PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH POLICY EXPERTS TO MAKE JUDGMENTS BASED ON DATA THAT WILL ULTIMATELY DEVELOP PATIENT CARE AND HELP BASED ON THE MEDICAL RECORDS FOR EXAMPLE TO PREDICT DISEASES BEFORE THEY EMERGE  NONETHELESS THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR DEMANDS DATADRIVEN DECISIONS IN CLINICIANS DAILY WORK AND AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL  ADOPTING THE BIG DATA APPROACH WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT PERSONALIZED AND PRECISE MEDICINE BASED ON PERSONALIZED INFORMATION DELIVERED IN REALTIME AND TAILORED TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL PATIENT   EXPECTED CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE SHOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MOVE FROM A SYSTEM DRIVEN BY AVERAGED STATISTICAL RESULTS AND GENERALIZATIONS TO ONE BASED ON DEFINING INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS IN REAL TIME  IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO OFFER PERSONALIZED AND PRECISE MEDICINE SERVICES BASED ON A PERSONS UNIQUE BEHAVIOURAL BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS THUS PERSONALIZING PATIENT TREATMENT ANYWHERE ANYTIME THIS LEADS TO BETTER RESULTS AND MAKES HEALTHCARE COSTEFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THESE SOLUTIONS SHOULD REPORT POSITIVE OUTCOMES ON ENHANCING AFFORDABILITY AND IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS ON DISEASE OR WELLBEING INDICATORS THE SUPPORTED SERVICE FOCUSES ON THE EARLY DETECTION OF DISEASES AND HOME CARE NOT CLINICAL EXCLUSIVITY  ALSO ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT WOULD BECOME MORE INDIVIDUALIZED THEY WOULD BE PROVIDED ON TIME BECAUSE MODERN WEB AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES COULD ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO MONITOR ROUTINE PATIENT HEALTH AND RESPOND TO EMERGING ISSUES NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES INTRODUCED IN PATIENT HEALTHCARE WOULD ENABLE OMNIPRESENT ACCESS IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY AD HOC SERVICE ARRANGEMENT ALTERATION SYSTEMS AND EVEN THE INTEGRATION OF PATIENTS CAREGIVERS AND MEDICAL WORKERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS AND INTELLIGENT ALGORITHMS WOULD ALLOW HEALTHCARE TO BECOME MORE COMPREHENSIVEMONITORING AND HELPING PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC DISEASES THAT REQUIRE CONSTANT CARE SPECIAL ATTENTION OR INTERVENTION  THE USE OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES AND WEARABLE DEVICES IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON AND PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO USE SUCH DEVICES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH REASONS MOBILE AND WEARABLE DEVICE DATA ARE RECORDED TO QUANTIFY PATIENT RESULTS SUPPORTING CLINICAL TRIALS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE  THE COMBINATION OF MOBILE HANDHELD TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER CONNECTED HEALTH DEVICES HAS AT LEAST A FEW POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN THE HEALTH FIELD HOWEVER IT MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO MONITOR LIFESTYLES RESULTS REPORTED BY PATIENTS PATIENT BEHAVIOUR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF MANY DISEASES BY ANALYSING DAILY HABITS THIS COULD TRANSFORM DATA FROM MOBILE DEVICES INTO PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE THAT CAN SUPPORT DECISIONMAKING BY SPECIALISTS AND PATIENTS  PERSONALIZED PATIENT CARE IS ONE OF THE FORMS OF HEALTHCARE THAT IS POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THANKS TO THE USE OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS THE USE OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE MECHANISMS AND BETTER HEALTHCARE BIG DATA ANALYTICS INVOLVES EXAMINING LARGE AND COMPLEX DATA SETS IE BIG DATA AND SELECTING VEILED INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP ORGANIZATIONS WITH EFFICIENT DECISIONMAKING   BDA REFERS TO THE PROCESS METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR ANALYSING SUCH LARGE DATA SETS AND DISCOVERING VALUABLE INFORMATION USING NONTRADITIONAL ADVANCED METHODS SUCH AS ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS GENETIC ALGORITHMS MACHINE LEARNING REGRESSION ANALYSIS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS  IN THE CREATION OF PERSONALIZED HEALTHCARE ANALYTICAL TOOLS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THE COMBINATION OF FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IS SO COMPLEX THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR IS UNABLE TO FULLY ANALYSE THEM IN REAL TIME DURING THE INTERACTION WITH A PATIENT   THEREFORE THE CONCEPT OF BDA CAN IMPROVE AND FACILITATE A COMMON APPROACH TO EASYTOMANAGE HEALTH FOR PATIENTS THE USE OF BDA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE MECHANISMS AND BETTER HEALTHCARE BASED ON DATA GENERATED BY INDIVIDUALS HOWEVER THERE ARE SEVERAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSING AND TREATING PATIENTS  THE FIRST ONE INVOLVES THE RELIABILITY AND QUALITY OF THE DATA THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BOTH IMPORTANT AND CONTROVERSIAL FOR YEARS NOW DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH THE COMPLETENESS ACCURACY RELIABILITY CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY OF THE DATA  MUCH OF THE BIG DATA PRODUCED IN HEALTHCARE IS MASSIVE AND IS USUALLY CONSIDERED DIRTY DATA MEANING THAT MUCH OF IT IS IRRELEVANT TO THE SPECIFIC TOPIC OF INTEREST EG A SPECIFIC DISEASE THERE IS NO PLACE IN HEALTHCARE FOR DECISIONS BASED ON POORQUALITY DATA ESPECIALLY THESE RELATED TO THE DISEASE THEREFORE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS OF USING BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE IS THE PREPROCESSING OF RAW DATA INCLUDING DATA CLEANING TRANSFORMATION AND REDUCTION OF MISSING AND NOISY DATA TO PROVIDE CLEAN AND RELIABLE DATA  IT IS FURTHERMORE VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE AND ADJUST THE INFORMATION WHICH IS ALSO NECESSARY FOR RELIABLE PREDICTIONS AND SIMULATIONS DATA FROM WEARABLE DEVICES AND HEALTHCARE DATA IN PARTICULAR SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND CAUTION UNLESS THEY HAVE BEEN CLINICALLY TESTED THE ACCURACY OF MEASUREMENTS IS NOT UNIFORM EVEN AMONG DEVICES DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES OVER TIME TRENDS THE RESULTS ARE MORE REASSURINGTHE CONSISTENCY OF THE MEASUREMENT IS MUCH MORE RELIABLE  TO OBTAIN TRULY ACCURATE DATA AT LEAST AT THE LEVEL REQUIRED BY CLINICIANS IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO USE CERTIFIED MEDICAL DEVICES HOWEVER DATA FROM MEDICAL DEVICES REMAINS IN THE MINORITY AND MEDICAL GRADE DEVICES ARE BOTH EXPENSIVE AND USUALLY CUMBERSOME TO WEAR THUS THE USE OF DATA IN THE TREATMENT PROCESS IS NOT POSSIBLE CONFIRMATION OF DETECTED ABNORMALITIES BY ADDITIONAL TESTING IS NECESSARY HOWEVER THE DATA CERTAINLY SHOWS TRENDS REVEALING HOLISTIC DATA ON A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL OVER TIME ON THEIR HABITS BEHAVIOURS LIFESTYLE AND VITAL PARAMETERS AND MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO CAPTURE ANOMALIES  AMONG THE CHALLENGES SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES AS LARGE DATA SETS OFTEN CONTAIN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION ESPECIALLY HEALTHRELATED INFORMATION IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE DATA THE INCIDENCE OF DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES IS INCREASING WITH SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RELATED TO CONFIDENTIALITY THERE ARE PRIVACY AND RELIABILITY ISSUES THAT HINDER THE FULL TRANSFER OF HEALTHCARE MONITORING DATA TO A CLOUD SERVICE PLATFORM  AS WELL AS DATA PRIVACY BREACHES AND INFORMATION LEAKAGE  THE PRIVACY OF PATIENTS DOCTORS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND TO LOOK AFTER IT IT IS NECESSARY TO BOTH INTRODUCE A SECURE DATA PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY AND FIND RISK INDICATORS THAT CAN BE QUICKLY IDENTIFIED TO IMPROVE THE PRIVACY PROTECTION OF HEALTHCARE PATIENTS AS WELL AS ESTABLISH STRICT COMPLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT RULES FOR DATA AND DATA SHARING WHILE ENCRYPTION PROTOCOLS SHOULD ENSURE THE SECURITY OF HEALTHCARE DATA TRANSMISSION  MANAGING THE DATA OF PATIENTS AND OTHER USERS OF WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS ENSURING SECURITY OF SUCH DATA ARE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON IDENTITY PROTECTION AND CONCEALMENT PROCEDURES TO ANONYMIZE PRIVATE DATA    AND ENSURE ITS SECURITY    THERE ARE VARIOUS SOLUTIONS AND TECHNIQUES USED TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA AND PRIVATE INFORMATION EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE COMBINED USE OF MATCHING THEORY AND COALITION GAME TO SECURE MOBILE SOCIAL NETWORKS WITH LARGE DATA SETS THE USE OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TO DESIGN A SECURITYSENSITIVE ALGORITHM FOR A SMART GRID SYSTEM OR BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AS A REGISTRY TECHNOLOGY PROVIDING AN ATTRACTIVE SOLUTION TO ENSURE SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN BIG DATA SYSTEMS   OTHER CHALLENGES INCLUDE THE TECHNICAL DIMENSION DIFFICULTIES IN DATA CAPTURE DATA STORAGE DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA VISUALIZATION DATA STRUCTURE BIG DATA SHOULD BE USERFRIENDLY TRANSPARENT AND MENUDRIVEN BUT IT IS FRAGMENTED DISPERSED RARELY STANDARDIZED AND DIFFICULT TO AGGREGATE AND ANALYSE DATA STANDARDIZATION DATA IS STORED IN FORMATS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ALL APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES STORAGE AND TRANSFERS ESPECIALLY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURING STORING AND TRANSFERRING UNSTRUCTURED DATA MANAGERIAL SKILLS SUCH AS DATA GOVERNANCE LACK OF APPROPRIATE ANALYTICAL SKILLS AND PROBLEMS WITH REALTIME ANALYTICS HEALTHCARE IS TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE BIG DATA IN REAL TIME   SUMMING UP IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT BDAIN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE LATTER BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME THIS PAPER IS A CONTINUATION OF RESEARCH THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN AN ARTICLE ON THE USE OF BIG DATA AND BIG DATA ANALYTICS IN HEALTHCARE   MODEL OF DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS THE ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL SOLUTIONS IN POLISH HEALTHCARE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A LACK OF A PLATFORM THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF MANAGING THE HEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF SOCIETY THEREFORE BASED ON THE LITERATURE ANALYSIS THE AUTHORS MODEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLAN PLATFORM IHPP A DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS IN THE HEALTHCARE AREA WAS PROPOSED  FIGURE  PRESENTS THE MODEL OF USING BIG DATA TO SUPPORT DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY OFTEN IDENTIFIED WITH PATIENTS ARE THE KEY BENEFICIARIES OF DSI BASED ON BDA BDA CAN HELP PROVIDE PERSONALIZED PATIENT CARE BASED ON DATA STREAMS SUPPLIED TO THE SYSTEM APPLICATION

WILL ACT AS RECOMMENDATIONS AND WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA SET THEREFORE SPECIAL ATTENTION WILL BE PAID TO THE ACCURACY AND INTEGRITY OF THE DATA WHEN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATIONS BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS WHEN CONSIDERING SYSTEMIC ISSUES THEY IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE EG THROUGH TELECONSULTATION AND ENABLE MONITORING OF POPULATION HEALTH ADVANCED DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO TRACK POPULATION HEALTH IDENTIFY TRENDS AND PREDICT HEALTH RISKS IN TERMS OF HUMAN RESOURCES THEY NOT ONLY OFFER SUPPORT IN DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC DECISIONMAKING BUT ALSO REPRESENT A RELIEF TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS A HEALTHIER POPULATION REQUIRES LESS INVOLVEMENT OF MEDICAL SPECIALISTS ANALYSING THE FINANCIAL AREA IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF BDABASED DSIS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SHORTENING OF THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS THROUGH ACCESS TO REAL DATA AND THUS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REDUCE THE COSTS OF UNNECESSARY OR DUPLICATE DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES VERY IMPORTANT ASPECTS ON THE PROCEDURAL LEVEL COULD INCLUDE THE IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR PATIENTS IN REAL TIME THE SOCIAL ASPECTS THAT BDABASED DSIS COULD INTRODUCE ARE MAINLY BETTER HEALTH EDUCATION FOR THE SOCIETY DIGITAL PLATFORMS CAN BE USED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT HEALTH HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION FOSTERING COMMUNITIES ONLINE PLATFORMS ENABLE THE CREATION OF PATIENT COMMUNITIES AND SHARING OF EXPERIENCES AND SUPPORT AND OFFERING SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONES HEALTH THE SOLUTIONS IN QUESTION COULD ALSO BE USEFUL IN THE FIELD OF INSURANCE AS HEALTH RISKS COULD BE ASSESSED MORE PRECISELY AND INSURANCE POLICIES COULD BE ADJUSTED ON THE BASIS OF DIGITALLY ACQUIRED DATA THIS IN TURN COULD ALLOW INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MANAGE THEIR CUSTOMERS HEALTH COSTS AND BENEFITS MORE OPTIMALLY HOWEVER LEGAL ISSUES SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED AS SPECIAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE PROCESSING OF DATA FROM WEARABLES FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES AND THE PROTECTION OF PATIENT DATA ARE NEEDED FOR THESE SYSTEMS TO BE PART OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE  IN CONCLUSION DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATIONS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS HELPING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE EFFICIENCY OF PROCEDURES QUALITY OF CARE AND FINANCIAL AND PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT HOWEVER THEIR INTRODUCTION REQUIRES APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AND DATA PROTECTION MEASURES TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY AND MAINTAIN PATIENT PRIVACY  MATERIALS AND METHODS THE ARTICLE PRESENTS DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION AND IDENTIFIES OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS USE IN HEALTHCARE MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITIES OF USING BIG DATA ANALYTICS IN CREATING A SPECIFIC DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION RELATED TO HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND CREATING A CULTURE OF HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN SOCIETY ARE ALSO DESCRIBED THE RESEARCH AND MODEL OF DSI BASED ON BDA PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER ARE SUPPORTED BY A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE AS WELL AS OWN OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS THIS MODEL CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER BIG DATA INFLUENCES DSI AND WHAT VALUES CAN BE CREATED FOR SOCIETY  THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY ALSO CONSISTED OF DATA COLLECTION METHODS TRANSCRIPTION ANALYSIS PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH WAS EXPLORATORY IN ITS NATURE AS THE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE ARTICLE WERE NOT SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE STUDIES AT THE SAME TIME THE PROBLEMS ARE COMPLEX AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO INITIAL VERIFICATION USING THE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEW METHOD THIS METHOD WAS CHOSEN BASED ON THE PROLONGED USE OF FOCUS GROUPS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND DESIGN SCIENCE THE FOCUSED INTERVIEW WAS HELD ON MAY   THE GROUP OF RESPONDENTS INCLUDED  PEOPLE THE PARTICIPANTS WERE SELECTED PURPOSEFULLYTHE FOCUS GROUP CONSISTS OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHO KNOW WHAT BIG DATA AND WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY ARE HAVE MOSTLY WORKED WITH THEM AND MAY BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM PROPOSED IN THE ARTICLE THE PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE HEALTHCARERELATED IT PROFESSIONALS OWNERS AND DIRECTORS OF MEDICAL FACILITIES DOCTORS AND NURSES  THE STRUCTURE OF THE FOCUS GROUP IS PRESENTED IN TABLE   TABLE  STRUCTURE OF THE FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS FULL SIZE TABLE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE CONNECTED TO HEALTHCARE THREE PEOPLE INDICATED MORE THAN  YEARS FIVE PEOPLE STATED IT TO BE BETWEEN  AND  YEARS ONE PERSON HAD BETWEEN  AND  YEARS AND ONE LESS THAN  YEARS  YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS ARE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT SYSTEMS AND BIG DATA TECHNOLOGY SOME OF THEM HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PROJECTS THAT TESTED VARIOUS TYPES OF IT SYSTEMS AND WEARABLES TECHNOLOGY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SURVEY THE RESEARCHER PROVIDED THE PARTICIPANTS WITH PRECISE CONSISTENT DEFINITIONS AND PRESENTED THEM WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE SOLUTION DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE IE THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLAN PLATFORM IHPP  THE STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL FOR USING BDA ESPECIALLY DATA FROM WEARABLES IN TERMS OF MANAGING ONES HEALTH AND IMPROVING THE WELLBEING OF SOCIETY AS WELL AS TO ASSESS THE PROPOSED SOLUTION IHPP AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION AS A COMPLEMENTARY SOLUTION TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDED BY MEDICAL FACILITIES IN POLAND THE RESEARCH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE RATIONALE OF THE IHPP AND EVALUATE ITS FUNCTIONALITY ESTABLISHING WHETHER ANALYSING HEALTHCARE BIG DATA ESPECIALLY DATA FROM WEARABLES IS LEGITIMATE IN THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSING AND TREATING PATIENTS OR WHETHER THE SOLUTION IS ONLY RECOMMENDED AS A SYSTEM FOR DAILY USE BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THE RESEARCH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ANALYSE THE MOTIVES AND PURPOSES OF USING THIS TYPE OF DATA AND ITS APPLICATION THE STUDY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY VARIOUS HEALTHCARE ENTITIES MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN USING THE PROPOSED IHPP  THE SURVEY IN THE FORM OF A FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEW WAS DESIGNED TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS AS PART OF THE SURVEY THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS  WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HEALTHCARE FUNCTIONING BASED ON HEALTHCARE BIG DATA BENEFITS FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES BENEFITS FOR THE WHOLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BENEFITS FOR THE PATIENT BENEFITS FOR THE DOCTOR BENEFITS FOR SOCIETY  IN YOUR OPINION WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF DATA DOCTORS USE AS THE BASIS FOR DIAGNOSING THE PATIENT AND PRESCRIBING THERAPY WHAT DATA DO THEY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL WHAT CAN BE CHANGED IN THIS REGARD CAN DATA FROM WEARABLES BE HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER  ARE WE MOVING TOWARD PERSONALIZED MEDICINE SHOULD PATIENTS SHARE DATA COLLECTED BY THEIR WEARABLES EG SMART WRISTBANDS WITH A MEDICAL FACILITY FOR BETTER DIAGNOSIS CAN SUCH DATA BE RELIED ON FOR DIAGNOSIS  WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO THE USE OF WEARABLES IN HEALTHCARE AND IHPP  WHAT BENEFITS CAN BIG DATA ANALYTICS WEARABLES AND THE IHPP BRING TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM  CAN THE USE OF WEARABLES AND OF THE IHPP HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ELIMINATING THE PROBLEMS HEALTHCARE IS CURRENTLY FACING IN POLAND PROBLEMS WITH THE AGING POPULATION OBESITY  SHOULD THE PLATFORM BE A COMPLEMENTARY SOLUTION TO THE EXISTING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR SHOULD IT BE A PART OF IT AND BE LINKED TO HEALTHCARE IT SYSTEMS  SHOULD HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMMES BASED ON BIG DATA ESPECIALLY DATA FROM WEARABLES BE CREATED WILL THE CREATION OF A PLATFORM BASED ON DATA ANALYSIS FROM WEARABLES THAT SUPPORT USERS IN MANAGING THEIR OWN HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETYS WELLBEING  WHAT WILL BE THE FUTURE OF USING WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY IN HEALTHCARE  THE METHOD FOR ANALYSING THE DATA FROM THE FOCUS GROUP SURVEY INVOLVED CODING THE WRITTEN TEXT OF THE SURVEYTHE SOCALLED TRANSCRIPTION THE TRANSCRIPTION AND CODING WERE SUBJECT TO THE ENTIRE TEXT WHICH INCLUDED A TOTAL OF ABOUT  PAGES INTENDED FOR ANALYSIS  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE RESULTS OF THE FOCUS GROUP CONFIRMED THE OBSERVATIONS AND PREVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED GUIDELINES REGARDING BOTH THE USE OF BDA IN HEALTHCARE AND IHPP FEATURES  QUESTION  WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HEALTHCARE FUNCTIONING BASED ON HEALTHCARE BIG DATA BENEFITS FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES BENEFITS FOR THE WHOLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BENEFITS FOR THE PATIENT BENEFITS FOR THE DOCTOR BENEFITS FOR SOCIETY  SURVEY PARTICIPANTS WERE VERY EAGER TO SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS ON THE BENEFITS OF USING REAL DATA IN HEALTHCARE THEY CONFIRMED THAT REAL DATA COULD BRING MANY BENEFITS TO VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTH SECTOR THEY AGREED WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE USE OF BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE COULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF PATIENTS ENABLING LONGTERM PREDICTIONS REGARDING THEIR HEALTH STATUS AND IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATE THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF BIG DATA AND ITS ANALYSIS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACCESS A HUGE DATABASE FOR MULTICROSSSECTIONAL ANALYSIS INCLUDING EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT MORBIDITY PREDICTION DETERMINATION OF UNIT PROBABILITIES OF DISEASES AND INFECTIONS DETECTION OF TRENDS THAT LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH AND LIFESTYLE OF POPULATIONS AND ANALYSIS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PREVENTIVE PROGRAMMES WELL IN ADVANCE BASED ON THE PARAMETERS OBTAINED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND STANDARDS OF HEALTHCARE  YES I HAVE A FULL DIAGNOSTIC  REVIEW SPANNING MANY YEARS ACTUALLY AT SOME POINT OF DATA THAT WE CAN PROVIDE EVERY DAY EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS WELL I CAN IMAGINE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS  SO DATA GIANT DATASETS  AND I THINK ANY APPROACH WILL BE GOOD WITH THIS AMOUNT OF DATA P  WELL THE MORE INFORMATION THE BETTER ITS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN THAT PREVENTIVE TREATMENT PREVENTION IN GENERAL IS CHEAPER THAN CORRECTIVE TREATMENT SO CERTAINLY ALSO FOR HEALTH CARE IN GENERAL THE ORGANIZATION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF JUST THE PAYER BUT ALSO THE WAY THE INFORMATION IS SENT AND TRANSMITTED I THINK IT IS WELL RELIABLE KNOWLEDGE DEFINITELY GIVES BETTER RESULTS P  SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE COULD ON THAT BASIS  IMPROVE THE QUALITY STANDARDS AND QUALITY OF ACTIVITIES IN MEDICINE P  BIG DATA ANALYTICS CAN ALSO BE IMPORTANT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PATIENT WHO IS THE MAIN BENEFICIARY OF MEDICAL SERVICES THE BENEFITS THAT REAL DATA ANALYTICS CAN BRING TO PATIENTS INCLUDE  FULL MONITORING OF VITAL PARAMETERS  REALTIME VERIFICATION OF ONES HEALTH STATUS  THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN INDIVIDUALIZED DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY  THE IMPULSE TO CONTACT THE DOCTOR IN CASE OF DEVIATIONS ABNORMAL DATA  THE ABILITY TO DEFINE TARGET ACHIEVABLE INDICATORS FOR PATIENTS AND CHECK THE DEGREE OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENT  THE BENEFITS SHOWN FOR THE PATIENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF WELLBEING CAN CONTRIBUTE TO GREATER SATISFACTION WITH LIFE  DATA MONITORING CAN RESULT IN AVOIDING ILLNESS AND MEDICALIZATION AND IN THIS CASE IN OBTAINING BETTER AND PERSONALIZED CARE PARTICIPANT  STATED  FROM A DOCTORS POINT OF VIEW ITS CERTAINLY LIKE ITS SEEN BY THE PATIENTS THAT THESE THINGS ARE MEASURED IN SOME WAY AND CAN SOMEHOW BE ASSIGNED A NUMBER FOR EXAMPLE AND A TARGET RANGE YOU CAN SEE THEM THAT ITS SO CONCRETE FOR THE PATIENTS AND THAT IT HELPS THEM  I WOULD LOOK MORE HERE NOT FROM THE ANGLE OF SUCH ONGOING VERIFICATION OF ONES HEALTH STATUS THROUGH THESE VARIOUS TELEMEDICINE DEVICES  I WOULD FOCUS MORE HERE ON SUCH SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS  IF SOMEONE SAW ON SOME WATCH OR DEVICE AT HOME THAT HE HAS SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS FROM THE NORM THEN AT THIS POINT HE MUST COME TO US AT THE CLINIC AND CHECK VERIFY FOR HIMSELF HIS TEST RESULTS  AT THIS POINT I WOULD NOT RELY ON THIS WEARABLES AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS BUT MORE ON SUCH A PERSONAL CHECK AND WITH SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS  THIS SHOULD BE A SIGN TO THE PATIENT THAT HE SHOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR  ALL DATA ANALYTICS ACTIVITIES ARE INTENDED TO SERVE THE PATIENTS SO THAT THEY CAN ACTIVELY PURSUE GOOD HEALTH WELLBEING AND A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE MODERN INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF SERVICE PROVIDERS SUPPORTED BY ANALYTICS SHOULD BECOME ESSENTIAL FOR PATIENTS HEALTH MANAGEMENT  AMONG THE BENEFITS FOR PHYSICIANS SURVEY PARTICIPANTS LISTED THE FOLLOWING  ACCESS TO COMPLETE PATIENT DATA  THE ABILITY TO CHECK WHETHER PATIENTS ARE ADHERING TO RECOMMENDATIONS SUCH AS DIET  THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSES BASED ON SUCH DATA  MORE CONCRETE CHECKING OF THE PATIENTS HEALTH STATUS  SCREENING THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE POPULATION RISK GROUPS ETC  THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ANALYTICAL SYSTEMS IN MEDICAL FACILITIES THAT ENABLE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO ACCESS COMPLETE HIGHQUALITY PATIENT HEALTH DATA USE AUTOMATED ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND THIS DATA ASSIST IN CLINICAL DECISIONMAKING AND PREDICT PATIENT HEALTH PROVIDING DOCTORS WITH ACCESS TO BIG DATA ANALYTICS COULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE AS THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO COMPLETE PATIENT DATA THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO CHECK WHETHER PATIENTS ARE ADHERING TO RECOMMENDATIONS EG DIET AND IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSES BASED ON SUCH DATA MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO PERFORM MORE CONCRETE CHECKING OF PATIENTS HEALTH AND SCREENING OF POPULATION HEALTH RISK GROUPS ETC ACCESS TO COMPLETE DATA IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS PARTICIPANT  AND  STRESSED  THE PROBLEM THAT IM SURE MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE OBSERVING DOCTORS ARE OBSERVING AS WELL CONCERNS THE FACT THAT PATIENTS VERY OFTEN FAIL DURING  VISITS TO MEDICAL FACILITIES TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW THEY MANAGE OR PERHAPS DONT EVEN MANAGE THEIR HEALTH  IF SUCH INFORMATION WAS SENT FROM ALL SORTS OF DEVICES BUT ALSO FROM AUTOMATIC MACHINES  IT WOULD CERTAINLY ASSIST THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS MAYBE NOT EXACTLY THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS P  MOST PEOPLE CONFABULATE BECAUSE THEY NEED A PRESCRIPTION FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE OR NEED TO TAKE A SICK LEAVE FOR WORK WELL THERE IS INFORMATION JUGGLING AND QUESTIONS SUCH AS DO YOU FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU FOLLOW THE DIET YES THEY DO  BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE ASHAMED TO ADMIT FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY DO NOT FOLLOW SUCH A DIET NO WAY TO VERIFY THAT AND THE RESULTS DONT CHANGE P  AN IMPORTANT ASPECT HIGHLIGHTED BY THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS IN TERMS OF PHYSICIAN BENEFITS WAS THE ACCESS TO COMPLETE DATA PARTICIPANT  SAID  ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASK EVERYTHING AT A DOCTORS VISIT AND THIS IS EVIDENT FOR EXAMPLE FROM LAB TESTS THAT OFTEN THE PATIENT IS ASKED FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH DIABETES OR ELEVATED BLOOD SUGAR OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE PAST OFTEN PATIENTS SAY NO AND THEN WHEN REVIEWING THE PATIENTS LABORATORY TESTS MOMENTS LATER HOWEVER IT COMES OUT THAT YES THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE AND FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS DIABETES AND THE PATIENT COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT IT SO THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL  IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO COLLECT A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA ABOUT THE PATIENT AND YOU COULD GO INTO AN APP OF SOME KIND  OR A TAB JUST LIKE LABORATORY TESTS THEN WHETHER BEFORE THE VISIT OR EVEN DURING THE VISIT THERE IS SOMETHING TO REFER TO  HOWEVER THEY POINTED OUT SEVERAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH USING SUCH DATA IN DIAGNOSING PATIENTS AND PRESCRIBING THERAPY IN THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS THE RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH THE DOCTOR SO THE PARTICIPANTS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF DATA FROM WEARABLES THEY EMPHASIZED THE FORMULATION OF PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSTIC CONCLUSIONS WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE CONFIRMED WITH FURTHER DIAGNOSTICS  MEDICAL FACILITIES THANKS TO THE ABILITY TO ACCESS BIG DATA ANALYTICS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE COMPLETE HISTORICAL DATA OF A PATIENT AND THEIR RECORDED DAILY PARAMETERS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER PERSONALIZED SERVICE PACKAGES TO PATIENTS  RESPONDENTS ALSO IDENTIFIED SEVERAL BENEFITS THAT SOCIETY COULD GAIN FROM REAL DATA ANALYTICS AMONG THE BENEFITS TO SOCIETY THEY MENTIONED PRIMARILY THE FOLLOWING  POSSIBLE CHANGE IN THE LIFESTYLE OF SOCIETY  THE POSSIBILITY OF MONITORING THE ELDERLY  THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTIVATING LIFESTYLE CHANGES  PERSONALIZED APPROACH TO EACH PERSON POTENTIAL PATIENT  DETECTION OF TRENDS THAT LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH AND LIFESTYLE OF SOCIETY  IT IS WORTH EMPHASIZING THAT THESE ARE ONLY POSSIBILITIES AS WHETHER THESE BENEFITS WILL BE ACHIEVED DEPENDS ON THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH AS PARTICIPANT  SAID  THE BENEFITS WOULD BE HUGE FOR EVERYONE IN FACT BOTH FOR THE PATIENT AND FOR THE DOCTORS AS WELL AS IN GENERAL FOR SOCIETY TOO YOU CAN REALLY SAY  THE BENEFITS WOULD BE IF WE COULD ENCOURAGE RIGHT NOW THIS SOCIETY PEOPLE WHO ARE A LITTLE OLDER TO CHANGE THIS LIFESTYLE A LITTLE  SUCH A SYSTEM WILL BE NEEDED BECAUSE SOCIETY IS ACTUALLY GETTING LESS AND LESS IN TOUCH SOMEWHERE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE NOW EVEN AS THEY WORK REMOTELY THEY DO NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE BECOMING MORE AND MORE STUPID AND THEY EAT THAT FAST FOOD EVEN MORE BECAUSE THEY HAVE IT DELIVERED SO I THINK THIS IS NEEDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW TO GIVE THEM THIS INFORMATION SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND IT SO THAT THEY STILL WANT TO CHANGE THEIR HABITS OR EATING OR EXERCISE HABITS TO GET THESE BENEFITS  QUESTION  IN YOUR OPINION WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF DATA THE DOCTORS USE AS THE BASIS FOR DIAGNOSING THE PATIENT AND PRESCRIBING THERAPY WHAT DATA DO THEY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL WHAT CAN BE CHANGED IN THIS REGARD CAN DATA FROM WEARABLES BE HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER  THE RESEARCH CONFIRMED THAT THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE DATA ARE ESSENTIAL TO DATA ANALYSIS ESPECIALLY IF DOCTORS WERE TO DIAGNOSE PATIENTS OR PRESCRIBE THERAPIES BASED ON SUCH DATA THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS RESTS WITH THE DOCTOR AS THEY ARE THE ONE WHO MAKES THE FINAL DECISION EVEN WHEN IT IS BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ONE PARTICIPANT STATED P  ITS ALWAYS TWO ASPECTS  ONE ASPECT IS  QUALITY AND THE OTHER IS RESPONSIBILITY AS FOR THE QUALITY ASPECT I REALIZE THAT IT IS NOT PRESUMABLY DRAMATICALLY DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE A DEVICE THAT HAS THE QUALITY OF COLLECTING GOOD COMPARABLE INFORMATION WELL OF COURSE THESE ARE SUCH DEVICES AND MEDICAL AND NONMEDICAL DATA WELL IN ANY CASE HERE WE ALWAYS HAVE FOR THE TIME BEING SOME CONFIDENCE LIMIT  ON THE OTHER HAND WELL WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER SOMETHING IS REGISTERED FOR MEDICAL USE OR NOT  FOR ME ANYTHING CAN BE A MEDICAL DEVICE  THE CERTIFICATION IS THERE SO THAT THE DOCTOR CAN USE IT RELY ON THE DATA IN A WAY THAT IS ALSO SAFE SAFE NOT ONLY FOR THE PATIENT YES BUT ALSO FOR HIMSELF AS A DOCTOR AND MAKE THESE DECISIONS  THE PATIENT MAY SUFFER HARM  THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN MEDICINE WELL THEN THE PROBLEM WILL BE THAT A NONCERTIFIED DEVICE WAS USED AND NO ONE IS GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS FUTURE GOODWILL THEREFORE IN ORDER TO DO SOMETHING THIS DEVICE SHOULD BE CERTIFIED  HOWEVER CERTIFICATION IS ONE THING AND QUALITY IS ANOTHER THING  RESPONDENTS ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF DEVICE CERTIFICATION OPINIONS ON THIS ISSUE VARY AS SOME RESPONDENTS CONSIDER CERTIFICATION AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS AND ONLY PARTIALLY INDICATIVE OF THE QUALITY OF APPROVED DEVICES  QUESTION  ARE WE MOVING TOWARD PERSONALIZED MEDICINE SHOULD PATIENTS SHARE DATA COLLECTED BY THEIR WEARABLES EG SMART WRISTBANDS WITH A MEDICAL FACILITY FOR BETTER DIAGNOSIS CAN SUCH DATA BE RELIED ON FOR DIAGNOSIS  THE SURVEY ALSO SHOWED THAT IT IS ALREADY A COMMON CLAIM THAT SOCIETY IS MOVING INCREASINGLY TOWARD PERSONALIZED MEDICINE THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE DATA FROM THEIR WEARABLES EG SMART WRISTBANDS WITH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL FACILITIES AS P STATED  ARE WE MOVING TOWARD PERSONALIZED MEDICINE ABSOLUTELY YES IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE POLISH MINISTRY OF HEALTH WILL WANT PATIENTS NOT TO BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WELL FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW EACH PATIENT IS DIFFERENT WELL DIFFERENT NEEDS HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THIS ALSO CONCERNS AILMENTS TREATMENT CAN BE DIFFERENT AND TREATMENT NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT  OF COURSE SOME GUIDELINES WILL BE PREPARED IN ADVANCE BUT YES FOR SURE WE ARE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST OPTIMAL THAT IS NOT TO MEASURE EVERYONE WITH THE SAME YARDSTICK JUST TO PREPARE AND TREAT DIAGNOSTICS ON THE BASIS OF INDIVIDUAL PARAMETERS OF A GIVEN PERSON  P ADDED   THE GREATER THE AMOUNT OF THIS DATA SENT TO THE MEDICAL FACILITY THE MORE RELIABLE THE RESULT OR THE GREATER THE QUALITY  EVERYTHING IS FORTUNATELY MOVING MORE AND MORE TOWARD AN INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH TO THE PATIENT P  QUESTION  WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO THE USE OF WEARABLES IN HEALTHCARE AND IHPP  HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE OF DATA SHARING WILL THE DATA BE AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING ONLY WILL THEY BE SAVED IN SOME DATABASE WILL THEY BE SAVED IN INDIVIDUAL RECORDS UNDER EACH PATIENT OR ONLY DOWNLOADED ANONYMOUSLY P SAID  WHEN IT COMES TO SHARING DATA I THINK THAT KNOWING THE POLISH SOCIETY SOME PEOPLE MAY BE OUTRAGED IT MUST ALSO BE SOME RIGHT OF THE PATIENT HOWEVER TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION AND IT WILL CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL  BUT DOES THE DOCTOR DURING THE VISIT HAVE TIME TO JUST REVIEW SUCH PATIENT DATA TO DIG INTO IT OR IS HE MORE SIMPLY GOING TO RELY ON THIS DATA ANYWAY WHICH IS FROM THE TEST RESULTS AND WHAT THE PATIENT SAYS P  THIS DOUBT ALSO CONNECTS TO RESPONDENTS BARRIERS TO ANALYSING MEDICAL BIG DATA AND IMPLEMENTING THE AUTHORS ORIGINAL IHPP PROPOSAL P STATED THAT  THE BARRIERS ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH SURVEILLANCE IN A SENSE BY SOME SYSTEM BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT AGREE BECAUSE I DONT ATTACH THAT MUCH IMPORTANCE TO IT ANYMORE  AMONG THE BARRIERS RESPONDENTS ALSO POINT TO THE PREVIOUSLY RAISED PROBLEM OF DATA RELIABILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC DECISIONMAKING BASED ON THIS DATA TYPE THEREFORE THIS PROBLEM CAN BE TREATED AS ONE THAT REQUIRES FURTHER EXPLORATION P SAID  THE BARRIERS CERTAINLY INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY OF THE DATA THAT IS BEING COLLECTED  P ADDED  I WOULDNT DARE TO DIAGNOSE PATIENTS ON THE BASIS OF SUCH DATA BECAUSE HERE ITS LIKE MONITORING THERES A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS THAT YOU CAN CHECK FOR YOURSELF  ITS SORT OF JUST ONE ELEMENT SOME KIND OF DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE THAT IS SOME KIND OF RISK LOAD THERE POTENTIALLY ON THE OTHER HAND IF ITS STRICTLY ABOUT THE PERSONS PROBLEMS SOME PRELIMINARY THERAPEUTIC DECISION MAY BE POSSIBLE ON THE BASIS OF SUCH DATA P  THE SURVEY ALSO POINTED OUT TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS ESPECIALLY IF THE USERS WERE TO BE ELDERLY PEOPLE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHO COULD ACCESS SUCH DATA THE APPLICATION WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE DATA AVAILABLE IN AN AGGREGATED FORM SUCH AS A DASHBOARD SINCE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME DURING A MEDICAL VISIT TO REVIEW ALL THE DATA P STRESSED   THE QUESTION IS ALSO HOW THE DATA WILL BE PRESENTED BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT WILL PROBABLY BE USEFUL TO HAVE SOME KIND OF SUMMARIES OR SOME KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING ONLY SOME KIND OF INCLUDE DASHBOARD WITH INDICATORS  SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND YOU CAN SEE SOME TRENDS  THE STUDY ALSO RAISED A PROBLEM RELATED TO THE MENTALITY OF DOCTORS AND PATIENTS IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT RECOMMENDATION APPS COULD BE POORLY PERCEIVED BY DOCTORS WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE THE BEST ONES TO DIAGNOSE THE PATIENT AND PRESCRIBE THERAPIES THEREFORE AS RIGHTLY NOTED SUCH A SYSTEM COULD ONLY BE A RECOMMENDATION AND AS NOTED EARLIER BASED ON DATA FROM WEARABLES ONLY PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSES CAN BE CONSIDERED IT IS NECESSARY TO VERIFY THE HEALTH STATUS OF A PARTICULAR PERSON FULLY P STATED  DOCTORS HAVE A VERY STRONG RESISTANCE ALSO TO THE FACT THAT A MACHINE CAN BE BETTER THAN THEM AND I KNOW THAT DOCTORS HAVE A BIT OF A GOD COMPLEX YES BUT THEY ARE ALSO EASY TO APPROACH BECAUSE I ALWAYS SAY LISTEN HE WONT BE SMARTER THAN YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE WHO MAKES THESE DECISIONS AT THE END OF THE DAY THE SYSTEM ONLY RECOMMENDS AND YOU CAN STILL IMPROVE THIS RECOMMENDATION AND APPLY THE FINAL TOUCH THE FACT IS THAT IVE HEARD IT A COUPLE OF TIMES ALREADY THAT IT CANT BE A SYSTEM THAT REPLACES THE DOCTOR JUST A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE DOCTOR CAN MODIFY IMPROVE AND HE WILL THEN BE SATISFIED BECAUSE ITS NOT THE SYSTEM THAT DID IT HE JUST SIGNED OFF AT THE END AND SAID THATS GOOD  ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN CONSIDERING THE MENTALITY OF PATIENTS RESPONDENTS POINTED OUT THAT PEOPLE DONT WANT TO KNOW AT ALL IF THEY ARE SICK AND WHEN GIVEN UNMEASURED DATA THEY MAY MISS THE TRUTH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE THE DATA MEASURED BY WEARABLES MORE SERIOUSLY OR THAT THEY ARE NOT MOTIVATED TO USE THESE DEVICES OR APPS MAY ALSO BE A PROBLEM P SAID  PEOPLE DONT WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE SICK THATS WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS BUT THATS OUR SOCIETY  P IN TURN COMMENTED AND ASKED  WE AS A SOCIETY KNOW VERY WELL THAT WE SHOULD EAT WELL THAT WE SHOULD KEEP FIT AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT DO WE DO IT AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE DO IT WHAT IS THE ONLY THING WE CAN LOOK AT HOW MANY PEOPLE GO FOR WALKS HOW MANY PEOPLE EXERCISE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH WHAT DO THEY EAT UNFORTUNATELY FAST FOOD ITS POPULAR AND SO ON AND WE KNOW IT ALL ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER HAND WE DONT APPLY IT TO YOU ANYWAY  IF I HAVE SUCH AN APP OR IF I HAVE SUCH A DEVICE WILL I HAVE ANYTHING EXTRA BECAUSE THAT WOULD MOTIVATE ME P  THE LINK TO TRANSACTIONAL DATA WAS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL FEATURE OF THE IHPP SOLUTION PRESENTED BY THIS STUDY RESPONDENTS POINTED OUT POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH ANALYSING SHOPPING DATA NAMELY THE INABILITY TO ASSOCIATE SPECIFIC ITEMS ON A SHOPPING LIST WITH A SPECIFIC PERSON WHEN SHOPPING FOR A LARGER NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO SHARE TRANSACTIONAL DATA DUE TO BOTH FEAR OF DATA SECURITY AND POSSIBLE NEGATIVE REVIEWS CATCHING FRAUD OR ASSESSING A SMALL FOOD BUDGET AS P STRESSED  THERE ARE SOME DATA THAT A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION MAY NOT WANT TO SHARE FOR EXAMPLE THE ISSUE OF THESE PURCHASES MAY ALREADY BE COMING UP THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS DATA IS ALREADY TOO SENSITIVE  SHOPPING IS SOMETHING ELSE HEALTH IS HEALTH ITS AS IF WE DONT QUITE HAVE CONTROL OVER HEALTH DATA  BECAUSE NO ONE CHOOSES TO GET SICK NO ONE WANTS TO GET SICK THATS NOT PEOPLES GOAL WHEREAS SHOPPING IS  WELL IT COULD INDEED BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PREDISPOSITIONS WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT COULD STEM FROM MATERIAL ISSUES IT COULD STEM FROM DIFFERENT KINDS OF HABITS IT COULD BE DUE TO OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT AT THE MOMENT AND THATS THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT SHOULD RATHER BE ONLY IN A LIMITED SCOPE THAT IS THAT IT SHOULD BE ACCESSED BY LETS SAY SOME KIND OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS ABLE TO HANDLE IT APPROPRIATELY WITH THE HELP OF APPROPRIATE ALGORITHMS  P  A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY P P AND P  IT WILL PROVE TO YOU THAT YOU ARE EATING BADLY AND YOU SAY THE OPPOSITE SO I THINK ALSO IN THIS RESPECT THAT PATIENTS WOULD NOT QUITE WANT TO SHARE THEIR INFORMATION  WHEN IT COMES TO NUTRITION P  I ALSO DONT THINK THAT SUCH SHARING OF THIS DATA WOULD BE ADVISABLE AND PATIENTS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT BECAUSE I ASSUME THAT I DONT KNOW A PATIENT WHO WOULD LIKE TO JUST HAVE THEIR PURCHASING DATA SHARED SOMEWHERE P  IF THE APPLICATION IS TO BE LINKED PRECISELY TO THE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE EXACT PRODUCTS WE BUY FOR EXAMPLE FOOD WE HAVE A CONSTANT PROBLEM IN POLAND WHEN IT COMES TO SHARING OUR DETAILED PURCHASE HISTORY POLES DONT WANT TO SHARE THEY DONT WANT ANYONE TO KNOW WHAT WE DO WHAT WE BUY WHERE WE BUY IT WE HAVE HUGE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BESIDES THE SHADOW ECONOMY EXISTS ALL THE TIME AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BUY WITH CASH SO THIS WONT EVEN BE RECORDED  SO I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO AUTOMATE THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATING THESE PURCHASES P  QUESTION  WHAT BENEFITS CAN BIG DATA ANALYTICS WEARABLES AND THE IHPP BRING TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM  AS PART OF THE APPLICATIONS THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ALSO ASKED TO IDENTIFY WHAT BENEFITS IHPP COULD BRING TO THEIR POTENTIAL USERS AND WHAT FEATURES IT SHOULD HAVE MANY RESPONDENTS INDICATIONS OVERLAPPED WITH THEIR INDICATIONS WHEN USING BIG DATA ANALYTICS AND DATA FROM WEARABLES THEY POINTED TO ACCESS TO MONITORING OF ONES HEALTH BY INDIVIDUALS AND THE ABILITY TO SHARE DATA WITH A DOCTOR WHO CAN DRAW CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS BASED ON IT THE SUGGESTIONS RESPONDENTS MADE REGARDING THE FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES OF THE ANALYSED SOLUTION BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT VALUE THE SUGGESTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS  THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE SO THAT IT ONE DOES NOT NEED TO USE MANY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS  THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO BOAST ABOUT THE RESULTS AND TO ENTER STATISTICS WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED BY ADDING SOCIAL NETWORKING OPTIONS  ANALYSIS OF PURCHASES IN TERMS OF NUTRITIONAL AND HARMFUL SUBSTANCES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE  THE SYSTEM SHOULD GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON FOR EXAMPLE SHOPPING  AN EXTENSIVE INCENTIVE SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THE NEEDS OF USERS AND THEIR PERSONALITY TRAITS  THE SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE A FEATURE FOR MONITORING ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE BY FAMILY MEMBERS  QUESTION  CAN THE USE OF WEARABLES AND OF THE IHPP HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ELIMINATING THE PROBLEMS HEALTHCARE IS CURRENTLY FACING IN POLAND PROBLEMS WITH THE AGING POPULATION OBESITY  THE SURVEY PARTICIPANTS FELT THAT ANALYSING DATA FROM WEARABLES AND THE PROPOSED IHPP COULD BE HELPFUL IN MITIGATING ESSENTIAL HEALTHCARE ISSUES INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS THE AGING POPULATION AND OBESITY  THEY EMPHASIZED THAT IHPP COULD GIVE THEM ACCESS TO MONITORING DATA OF FOR EXAMPLE PARENTS WHO LIVE SEPARATELY WHICH WAS STRESSED BY P AND P   WHEN PARENTS LIVE AWAY FROM THEIR CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE THE LATTER WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DATA TO SEE THAT A PARENT IS OKAY MONITORING SENIORS WHO LIVE ALONE AND BEING ABLE TO JUST SEE IF THEYRE OKAY WOULD ALSO BE EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING THAT SUCH A PLATFORM COULD ALLOW P  P   BECAUSE STILL IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLACES THEN EVEN MORE SO YES THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING SO THAT ONLY SUCH DATA FLOWS TO THEM THERE THAT EVERYTHING IS OK AND THAT THERE IS CONTACT OR THAT THIS PERSON HAS THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY CALL FOR HELP SOME KIND OF RESPONSE IN A SEMIAUTOMATIC MANNER P  IHPP COULD BE A SOLUTION FOR PARENTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES EG AUTISM DOWN SYNDROME THIS WAS STRESSED BY P AND P   PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME ARE OFTEN ON THE LEVEL OF A LITTLE BIGGER CHILD  BUT THEY ARE ABLE TO LEARN SOME INTERESTING BASIC SUCH ACTIVITIES  THERE IS NOT EVEN SUCH A DEVICE FOR THEM TODAY AND THIS WOULD ALSO BE A NICE JUST TO MONITOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEIZURES OF EPILEPSY FOR EXAMPLE THEY GET LOST SOMETIMES THEY DO NOT HAVE FITS OF AGGRESSION WELL DIFFERENT THINGS P  IN FACT THE DEMAND FOR SUCH APPLICATIONS IS GIGANTIC AND ITS GOING TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER BECAUSE MORE AND MORE CHILDREN ARE BEING DIAGNOSED ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM FOR EXAMPLE P  THE RESPONDENTS ALSO POINTED OUT THE PROBLEMS THAT CAN ARISE IN MONITORING THE ELDERLY FOR INSTANCE NUMEROUS HEALTH PROBLEMS AND AILMENTS IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO SUCH A SYSTEM EARLY TO BE MORE CONSCIOUS AND HEALTHIER SENIORS FOR EXAMPLE P SAID  WITH SENIORS IT VARIES BECAUSE AS FAR AS PREVENTION IS CONCERNED IT IS A SIMPLE MATTER IT WILL DEFINITELY HELP IF IT WORKS IT WILL HELP IN THE SENSE OF BEING WIDESPREAD AND SO ON AND SO FORTH  OLDER PEOPLE MOSTLY GET SICK FROM SOMETHING CAN SUCH APPLICATIONS REALLY HELP  HOW MUCH CAN IT HELP HOW MUCH CAN IT BE A BOTHER BECAUSE OLDER PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF AILMENTS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS CAN APPEAR AND EVERY TIME YOU HAVE TO INTERVENE IN SOME WAY AND THE OLDER SOMEONE IS THE MORE CAREFUL YOU HAVE TO BE WITH DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS  QUESTION  SHOULD THE PLATFORM BE A COMPLEMENTARY SOLUTION TO THE EXISTING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR SHOULD IT BE A PART OF IT AND BE LINKED TO HEALTHCARE IT SYSTEMS  THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THE PROPOSED SYSTEM SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN POLAND IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE IT WITH THE INTERNET PATIENT ACCOUNT A NATIONWIDE EHEALTH SYSTEM SO THAT CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN ABOUT PREVENTION PROPHYLAXIS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY WITH THE HELP OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ONLY THEN WILL IT BE POSSIBLE TO FULLY UTILIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND PROVIDE SAFE USERFRIENDLY SOLUTIONS MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO FUNCTION IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN ADDITION DURING A VISIT THE DOCTOR COULD COLLATE DATA FROM THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLAN PLATFORM WITH DATA COLLECTED IN THE INTERNET PATIENT ACCOUNT POLISH EHR P SAID WELL OF COURSE ITS BETTER IF ITS CONNECTED P A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY P  IT SHOULD BE JUST SUCH A PLATFORM THAT MEDICAL FACILITIES JOIN AND AT THE SAME TIME MAKE AVAILABLE TO THEIR PATIENTS  TO CREATE SUCH A NATIONWIDE HEALTH PLAN PLATFORM MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ONLINE PATIENT ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ALL THE PATIENTS DATA VISIBLE IN THE SYSTEM AT THIS POINT P  P STRESSED THAT IT WOULD BE A BIG LOSS IF THE DATA WERE NOT COMBINED AND AGGREGATED AND SUBSEQUENTLY USED TO ANALYSE AND PREDICT POPULATION HEALTH  IT WOULD BE A GREAT LOSS IF A LOT OF PEOPLE USED ONLY THEIR DATA AND IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE SOME EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ESTIMATES FROM THIS  ACCESS THROUGH AN ONLINE ACCOUNT OR  SHOULD BE COLLECTED IN DATABASES  SUCH DATA FROM SUCH SYSTEMS WHICH COVER A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WELL NECESSARILY THEY SHOULD BE ANALYSED YOU CAN THEN OBSERVE IN GENERAL SOME TRENDS GOING IN THIS OR THAT DIRECTION OR ALARMING ONES  OR YOU CAN ALSO TEST FOR EXAMPLE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME ACTIONS SO THAT THEY ARE TAKEN ON A GLOBAL LEVEL  NO LONGER IN CONTACT BETWEEN DOCTOR PATIENT BUT AT SOME HIGHER GLOBAL LEVEL AND WHETHER IT AFFECTS SOME KIND OF BEHAVIOUR OR HEALTHPROMOTING BEHAVIOUR P  QUESTION  SHOULD HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMMES BASED ON BIG DATA ESPECIALLY DATA FROM WEARABLES BE CREATED WILL THE CREATION OF A PLATFORM BASED ON DATA ANALYSIS FROM WEARABLES THAT SUPPORT USERS IN MANAGING THEIR OWN HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETYS WELLBEING  THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THAT BASED ON THE DATA COLLECTED BY WEARABLES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLAN PLATFORM HEALTH PROMOTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMMES COULD BE CREATED TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE FUTURE P SAID  PARTICIPATING IN A PROGRAMME A HEALTHPROMOTING STYLE MOTIVATES THE USER A LITTLE MORE WHEN I GO IN FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE SOME KIND OF HEALTHPROMOTING PROGRAMME LIKE FIGHTING OBESITY AND I HAVE A WEEK PROGRAMME LAID OUT FOR EXAMPLE IM SUPPOSED TO USE THAT WEEK PROGRAMME AT THE END IT IS JUST SHOWN THAT I WILL LOSE SO MUCH WEIGHT MY BODY FAT WILL IMPROVE I WILL LOSE THIS MUCH I WILL GAIN THIS MUCH  P  PARTICIPANTS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT A REWARD MODEL BASED ON POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS SOLUTION ALONG THE LINES OF THE NORMALIZED CHINESE MODEL THIS VIEW IS SHARED ESPECIALLY BY P P P  THIS IS SUCH A PLATFORM FOR MONITORING POTENTIAL ACTIONS AND CHECKING TO WHAT EXTENT THEY HAVE EFFECTS  IF INDEED A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE MONITORED IN SUCH A PLATFORM THEN A LOT OF THINGS COULD BE CHECKED THEN ITS ALREADY POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE DIFFERENT THINGS FOR EXAMPLE FOR SPECIFIC CITIES P  THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE IF SOMEONE IS MOTIVATED ITS JUST TO HELP SYSTEMATIZE  TRY TO BUILD A SYSTEM JUST TO MOTIVATE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES NUTRITION PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BUT THEIR IDENTITY IS UNKNOWN ITS TARGETING RANDOM PEOPLE  IF SOMEONE NEEDS IT MAYBE THEY WILL LIKE IT MAYBE IT WILL BE COOL HE WILL USE IT BUT THE POINT IS TO STIMULATE THAT NEED TO USE IT BUT HERES THE PROBLEM YOU WOULD HAVE TO KNOW THE PERSONALITY OF THE PERSON AT THE BEGINNING THAT IS FIRST TO RECOGNIZE TO DIAGNOSE THEIR PERSONALITY TRAITS BUILD A PROFILE AND ON THE BASIS OF SUCH A PROFILE PROVIDE JUST THIS RECOMMENDATION P  FOR EXAMPLE SUCH A CHINESE MODEL  COLLECTING POINTS FOR DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN REWARDING  THIS NEW SOCIETY  THEY DONT REALLY ACCUMULATE LIKE THE OLDER SOCIETY  YOUNG PEOPLE WANT REWARDS HERE AND NOW THEY CAN SAVE FOR A MONTH OR TWO MAYBE MAXIMUM THREE IF THEY DONT GET A REWARD HERE AND NOW THEN THEY GIVE UP THIS OPTION P  QUESTION  WHAT WILL BE THE FUTURE OF USING WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY IN HEALTHCARE THE RESPONDENTS SEE THE FUTURE OF USING DATA FROM WEARABLES AS POSITIVE THEY BELIEVE THAT ALL THE MEASURING DEVICES WE HAVE AT HOME BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS THERMOMETERS GLUCOMETERS EVEN STETHOSCOPES WILL BECOME CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET WITHIN FIVE YEARS BASED ON THE DATA ANALYSIS THEY WILL CREATE PERSONALIZED SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND OFFER DISCOUNTS ON HEALTHCARE EG MEDICINES SERVICES INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE  IN  YEARS ITS THOUGHT THAT C THE DEVICES WE CONSTANTLY USE TO MEASURE OUR BLOOD PRESSURE TO MEASURE OUR SUGAR  THERMOMETER  WILL BE DIGITIZED SO MUCH THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY AUTOMATICALLY SEND THIS DATA TO THE CLOUD AND THE CLOUD WILL JUST GIVE US A RECOMMENDATION RIGHT AWAY P  DATA IS THE FUTURE WELL ALREADY HEALTHCARE PROBABLY CANT FUNCTION WITHOUT DATA  THE ACCELERATION WAS GIVEN BY THE PANDEMIC HERE LETS NOT KID OURSELVES IF IT WASNT FOR THE PANDEMIC WE WOULD PROBABLY CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH MANY THINGS BUT HERE IS SUCH A NICE ACCELERATION JUST AFTER THE PANDEMIC P  MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC COULD BE INDUCED TO GIVE WAY TO JUST SUCH HEALTH DATA OR TRANSACTIONAL DATA SO THAT THEY COULD GET FOR EXAMPLE PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE RESULTS WE SEND ALL OUR DATA AND BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR ACTIVITY RESEARCH IS ABLE TO GIVE US A RECOMMENDATION SO TO SPEAK AND FOR EXAMPLE PREPARE A SET OF VITAMINS SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR NEEDS WITH THE EXACT INGREDIENTS THAT WE LACK SHE MADE THE ORDER AND SENT ME AN EMAIL WHERE I HAVE TO PRESS ONLY BUY NOW P  THE FUTURE OF ANALYSING SUCH DATA IN THE SENSE OF SEEING WHAT IS MALFUNCTIONING WHERE AND HOW SOMETHING CAN BE IMPROVED OR HAS IT HAD AN EFFECT DATA FROM THESE DEVICES CAN BE ANALYSED  AND IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PLAN IN A MORE PRECISE AND EFFECTIVE WAY CERTAIN MEASURES THE BIG STRATEGIC ONES RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF HEALTHSEEKING BEHAVIOUR SO TO SPEAK P  PERHAPS SOMEDAY IT WILL BE THE CASE THAT FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE SOMEHOW ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH LETS SAY BY EXERCISING OR TAKING CARE OF THEIR DIET OR SOME PARAMETERS THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE USING FOR EXAMPLE WRISTBANDS COULD GET SOME BENEFITS IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE I DONT KNOW FASTER ACCESS TO A DOCTOR OR CHEAPER DRUGS  WHATS HAPPENING IN CHINA ALTHOUGH I DONT KNOW ABOUT IT EXACTLY BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME SORT OF I GUESS SOCIAL POINTS THERE THAT CITIZENS GET POINTS FOR SORTING THEIR WASTE AND THEY LOSE POINTS IF THEY DONT DO IT PROPERLY  P  CONCLUSIONS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN POLAND IS PROGRESSING INTENSIVELY THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION IN  HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SERVICES BY PATIENTS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IT HAS ALSO ACCELERATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE HEALTH IT INITIATIVES IN POLAND THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE NEW SOLUTIONS FOR AMONG OTHER THINGS PREVENTION DIAGNOSIS THE TREATMENT PROCESS MANAGEMENT OF BROADLY UNDERSTOOD HEALTH FINANCING FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES OR CONDUCTING VARIOUS TYPES OF ANALYSES AT THE SAME TIME IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT THE MOST CRUCIAL LINK IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS THE PATIENT WHICH IS WHY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE FOCUSED ON MAKING THE HEALTH OF EVERY POLE THE BEST IT CAN BE  TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OFFERS ITS CITIZENS MANY DIGITAL SERVICES FOR RESEARCH FASTER DIAGNOSIS AND HEALTH IMPROVEMENT HOWEVER EVERY PERSONS PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELLBEING DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON MEDICAL FACILITIES IT IS INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS LIFESTYLE GENETIC CONDITIONS AVAILABLE HEALTHCARE AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THEREFORE HEALTH SYSTEMS SHOULD INVOLVE THE PATIENT IN MANAGING THEIR HEALTH FROM ADHERING TO PREVENTION GUIDELINES MOTIVATING THEM TO LEAD HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES TO MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SUCH ENGAGEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY PROVIDING PATIENTS WITH DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION SOLUTIONS BASED ON BDA SUCH DIGITAL SOLUTIONS OFFER SUPPORT TO PATIENTS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND MAINTAINING HEALTH BASED ON ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM VARIOUS SOURCES WEARABLES OTHER APPS OR THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM DATA FROM MEDICAL FACILITIES SUCH AS TEST RESULTS  ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO DEFINE THE ROLE PLACE OF BDA IN DEVELOPING SOCIAL INNOVATIONS IN HEALTHCARE THE ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT DSI ARE IN WHICH AREAS OF HEALTH PROTECTION THEY CAN BE APPLIED HOW BDA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT VALUES THEY CAN BRING TO THE SOCIETY THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT BIG DATA ANALYTICS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP SOCIAL INNOVATIONS IN HEALTHCARE  THE RESULTS OBTAINED WILL BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF USING BDA IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL INNOVATIONS IN HEALTHCARE THE AUTHORS FUTURE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON EXAMINING WHICH VALUES CAN WIN OVER DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS OF SOCIETY SOCIETY CITIZENS HEALTHCARE UNITS THANKS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DSI IN THE FORM OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS SUPPORTING THE MONITORING OF CITIZENS HEALTH AND RECOMMENDING HEALTH PATHS DIRECT RESEARCH WILL BE PERFORMED BASED ON THE MODEL OF DIGITAL SOCIAL INNOVATION IN TURN BASED ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS AS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER  THE RESULTS OF THE CONCEPTUAL STUDY AND FOCUS SURVEY ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES TO CONSIDER WHEN DESIGNING A HEALTH AND WELLBEING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMAPPLICATION IT ALSO HAS SOME PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE WEARABLE DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AND COMMUNITY PLANNERS ON WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THEIR DESIGN FURTHERMORE OUR RESULTS PROVIDE INSIGHTS FOR SOCIAL PLANNERS ON PROMOTING BETTER QUALITY IN HEALTHCARE SERVICES THE STUDY PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR HEALTH POLICY ON HOW WEARABLES AND HEALTHPROMOTING PLATFORMS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE POPULATIONS HEALTH QUALITY OF LIFE EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND DISEASE SUPPORT WHICH SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO STRATEGIES IN THIS AREA  HOWEVER THE PRESENTED RESEARCH HAS SOME LIMITATIONS IT PRESENTS A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND DEPICTS THE AREA OF APPLICATION OMITTING THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED PLATFORM WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED AFTER DIRECT RESEARCH CONDUCTED WITH POTENTIAL USERS OF THE SYSTEM FOCUS SURVEYS AND REPERTORY SAMPLE INTERVIEWS
